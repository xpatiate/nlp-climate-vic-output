# nlp-climate-vic-output

This repo contains output of an NLP research tool on a dataset of Victorian local government climate policy documents.

The data is based on the documents in [this dataset](https://github.com/xpatiate/nlp-climate-vic-dataset/). Two full analyses of the dataset were conducted.

The same data is represented in two ways:

* `by-lga` contains two analyses for each local government area which has a publicly available climate or environmental sustainability policy as at March 2024;

* `by-attribute` contains the same data but organised by the 10 attributes of the framework used to structure the analysis.
