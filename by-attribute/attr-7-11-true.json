The plan outlines the development of a Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan as a priority. This plan will involve a risk assessment to identify and assess the impacts of climate change and prioritize actions to manage these risks. The plan will consider the findings of the 3 yearly Community Emergency Risk Assessment (CERA), many of which are climate-related. The plan also outlines specific actions such as the drafting of a Tree Management Plan, which includes strategies for the maintenance of aging trees, tree selection and planting, and conservation of avenues of trees. Other actions include the development of a drought tolerance strategy, which involves defining the 'greenness' of each open space and increasing drought-tolerant garden beds over water-intensive annuals.",

The plan's focus areas and objectives are designed to build a climate-resilient community and environment. For instance, the plan aims to reduce risks from climate change impacts on the delivery of Council services and the use of council facilities. It also plans to manage the increasing risk of bushfire and establish measures to enhance urban tree canopy to reduce urban heat. Furthermore, the plan encourages sustainable agriculture and promotes community and home-based food growing to ensure climate-resilient food systems. The plan also includes a commitment to incorporate a stronger climate lens into the development and updating of various Council strategies and plans.",
