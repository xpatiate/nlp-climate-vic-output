While the documents outline the Alpine Shire Council's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and developing a Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan, they do not specifically mention efforts to build local capacity or partnerships with neighbouring councils for climate action. The documents focus primarily on the council's own operations and strategies, such as planning scheme amendments, support to community groups, and education opportunities. However, the explicit encouragement of capacity building across council, local communities, and neighbouring councils is not mentioned.",

The plan does mention the City's commitment to the TAKE2 Pledge and its goal to be carbon neutral by 2040, but these do not directly relate to the question of building local capacity or partnerships with other councils.",
