The document details actions to be taken in each year across various areas such as developing a low carbon workplace, reducing emissions from waste, buildings, parks and reserves, fleet, and street lighting. For instance, the policy mentions the continuation of using the internal Green Team to raise awareness and encourage change, facilitating staff education sessions to encourage low carbon behaviours, and reporting on the status of emissions reduction projects being implemented, all of which are planned for each year from 2018 to 2021.
