      "answer": "The documents provided do not explicitly show an intent to advocate upward to state and national governments to support climate action. While the Victorian State Government's Climate Change Adaptation Plan outlines broad actions such as leading by example, helping communities adapt, and partnering with local government, it does not specify advocacy to higher levels of government. Similarly, the Warrnambool City Council's Climate Change Action Plan focuses on local actions such as reducing emissions, managing climate risks, and building resilience, but does not mention advocacy to state or national governments. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that there is an explicit intent to advocate upward to state and national governments to support climate action.",

The policy documents focus primarily on the local government's own actions and strategies to address climate change, such as building knowledge of climate change impacts, integrating climate change measures into corporate policies, and working with key partners to ensure community understanding of climate risks. The documents mention partnerships with various entities, including the Gippsland Climate Change Network, DELWP, Latrobe Valley Authority, and Department of Health and Human Services, but these are not explicitly identified as state or national governments. Furthermore, the nature of these partnerships is not clearly defined as advocacy for climate action at higher levels of government.",

While the documents do mention the role of local government in climate change adaptation and the need for all levels of government to support efforts to adapt to climate change, they do not specifically state that the local government will advocate to higher levels of government for climate action. The documents do highlight the local government's commitment to lead by example, reduce its own emissions, and work with the community and businesses.
