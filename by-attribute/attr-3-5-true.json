The Climate Emergency Action Plan outlines that the climate emergency is one of the highest priorities, with new and existing resources being leveraged to respond to it. Non-essential functions and consumption may be curtailed or rationed through an emergency lens prioritisation process. The documents also mention that all reports to the council should consider and address the implications of the climate emergency. Furthermore, the climate emergency is considered in all council and organisational decisions. This indicates that the climate emergency response is prioritised over other policies.",

The policy outlines a comprehensive plan to address climate change, including specific actions, objectives, and strategies. The documents repeatedly emphasize the urgency of the climate emergency and the need for immediate and substantial action. The policy also outlines a hierarchy of actions, with the avoidance and reduction of energy use as the top priority, followed by increasing energy efficiency, generating renewable energy, and other steps. This hierarchy suggests that the climate emergency response is prioritized over other potential policies or actions. The policy also includes plans for regular reviews and updates, indicating a commitment to ongoing prioritization of the climate emergency response.",

      "answer": "The documents clearly state that the local government's response to the climate emergency is a high priority. The Climate Emergency Strategy and Action Plan explicitly prioritizes policies and actions that provide for both mitigation and adaptation in response to global warming and climate change. This is intended to drive emergency action to reduce greenhouse gases in line with global efforts to keep global warming below 1.5°C. The documents also emphasize that this continues to be a key priority in the next Council Plan. Furthermore, the documents detail the integration of climate change considerations into the development of Council’s 2021–25 Council Plan and supporting strategic documents. This includes the Council's updated Community Wellbeing Plan and other key supporting documents. Therefore, it is evident that the climate emergency response is given a high priority, even when compared to other policies.",
