The policy encourages the active participation of the community, businesses, and community groups in reducing emissions and driving change on the ground. The policy also emphasizes the importance of cross-sectoral collaboration and a clear and unified strategic direction. The City of Ballarat is expected to lead and/or facilitate most actions outlined in the plan, but the plan is designed to be implemented in partnership with the community. The policy also mentions the role of the City of Ballarat in influencing action beyond its control through advocacy and leadership. Therefore, it can be inferred that the policy encourages building local capacity across the council, their local communities, and potentially neighbouring local councils for climate action.",
