The documents provide several examples of such criteria, often referred to as 'indicators of success' or 'targets'. These indicators are clearly defined and quantifiable, allowing for objective evaluation of the policy's effectiveness. For instance, in the area of solid waste management, success is defined by the development of targets for waste reduction, a decrease in waste generation from Council offices by 15% compared to a 2010 baseline, and an increase in the proportion of waste recycled to 85%, among other criteria. Similarly, in the area of sustainable water use, success is marked by a 20% reduction in water consumption in Council buildings and operations compared to a 2009/2010 baseline, and the establishment of low water use gardens throughout public spaces in the municipality. These specific, measurable criteria provide a clear framework for evaluating the success of the policy's proposed actions.",

The plan outlines a series of actions, each with a corresponding Key Performance Indicator (KPI) to measure its success. For instance, the plan proposes to 'Develop and deliver an Integrated Water Plan' and the success of this action is measured by 'Annual reporting'. Similarly, the action to 'Investigate modification of construction practices for road and council infrastructure' is measured by its inclusion in the 'regular maintenance regime'. The plan also provides timelines for each action, further adding to the specificity of its measurable criteria.

      "answer": "The local government's plan does indeed include specific measurable criteria to evaluate the success of its proposed actions. The plan outlines a clear framework for monitoring and evaluating its performance. It states that the success of the plan will be evaluated against specific indicators such as a reduction in corporate greenhouse gas emissions by 30% on 2000 levels by 2020, increased use of renewable fuels in Council’s energy mix, and action that builds resilience to climate change impacts in Council’s operations, services, and infrastructure. The plan also mentions that it will be assessed annually through the Council's reporting framework, which will document and deliver specific climate resilience actions tailored to each area of the Council. This approach ensures that the plan's progress towards its targets is steady and measurable.",
