The local government's Climate Action Plan outlines a comprehensive approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with a target of achieving net zero emissions from Council operations by July 2023. The plan includes a range of innovative strategies, such as the implementation of the State Government Recycling Victoria Policy, which includes kerbside Food Organics and Garden Organics (FOGO) collection to minimise GHG emissions from municipal organics going to landfill. The plan also mentions the development of a Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan to ensure Council assets, and the community, are climate ready by addressing the consequences and impacts of changing weather patterns. Furthermore, the Council is considering the feasibility of including micro-grids in Planning and Amenity policies, which could enhance bushfire resilience.

The plan outlines a range of actions that are designed to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. These include investigating modifications to construction practices for road and council infrastructure, facilitating sustainable agricultural practices, developing an Urban Forest and Open Space Assets Strategy, and investigating more dispersed and diversified tourism opportunities. Each action is accompanied by detailed information on relevant risks, timelines, action ownership, resources required, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This level of detail suggests a comprehensive and innovative approach to climate action. The plan also includes the development of a repository of relevant information to support decision-making around infrastructure maintenance and development under climate change, and the use of digital technology to optimise asset management. These actions indicate a willingness to experiment with new approaches and technologies in the pursuit of climate action.",
