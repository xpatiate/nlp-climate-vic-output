The plan outlines various actions to be taken, each with a corresponding timeframe, funding source, and cost. For instance, the plan includes the establishment of a Monitoring, Evaluation, Reporting and Improvement (MERI) framework, the implementation of a cultural change program across the Council, and the establishment of a Climate Action Steering Committee. These actions are funded either through existing resources or new funding. The plan also includes actions to support the implementation of strategic plans in key areas such as waste and water, and to develop actions for new priority areas. These actions are funded through a combination of existing and new resources. However, the plan does not provide specific details on the amount of funding allocated for each action.",

For instance, the plan includes the establishment of a Monitoring, Evaluation, Reporting and Improvement (MERI) framework, which is funded from existing resources. Similarly, the plan outlines the implementation of a cultural change program across the Council, which is funded from new resources. The plan also includes actions to support renewable energy, such as investigating alternative procurement options, which are funded from new resources.

      "answer": "The Bass Coast 2021 Climate Change Action Plan does explicitly allocate funding for climate action. The plan outlines a range of approaches available to the Council for funding climate action. It mentions that many foundational actions require small financial investments and are primarily driven using existing resources. The plan also discusses the potential for operational savings from certain actions, which have an initial capital cost. For adaptation actions, the plan notes that most actions assist in avoiding a significantly higher future cost. The plan also mentions that for capital expenditure, borrowing represents a viable option. Furthermore, the plan discusses the integration of climate risk into financial decision making, which implies the allocation of resources to address climate risks.

The plan outlines various actions to be taken in response to climate change, each of which is associated with a specific investment. For instance, the plan includes actions such as organising self-funding events for community tree planting, promoting the need for alternative fuel sources in agriculture and transport, and encouraging residents to choose sustainable transportation options. Each of these actions is associated with a specific investment, denoted by dollar signs, indicating that funding has been allocated for these climate actions. However, the plan does not provide specific monetary values or percentages, making it difficult to assess the adequacy of the funding. The plan also does not detail the sources of the funding, whether it is from the local government budget, grants, or other sources.",

      "answer": "The local government's policy does explicitly allocate resources for climate action, although it does not specify the exact amount of funding. The policy outlines several actions related to climate change, such as updating emergency management plans, reviewing council policies for climate adaptation opportunities, and investigating the long-term costs of climate change. For each of these actions, the policy states that they will be resourced 'Within existing resources'. This suggests that the local government has allocated some portion of its existing resources to these climate actions. However, the policy does not provide specific details about the amount of funding allocated to each action, which could limit the effectiveness and accountability of these measures.",

The plan outlines the allocation of additional staff resources and operational budget to implement the actions outlined in the plan. For instance, an annual budget of $21,465 is identified for Action 1a to make the current casual Sustainability Project Officer position permanent. The plan also includes a new budget of $10,000 per year for a climate response communication and training program for staff and councillors. Furthermore, the plan proposes a new staff resource and a consultant budget of $50,000 for developing a business case to transition Council buildings and assets off gas to electric. These allocations demonstrate a clear commitment to funding climate action.",
