      "answer": "While the policy does address climate action, it is not the core purpose or goal of the policy. The policy is a broader Environment Strategy, and climate action is one of the key themes within it. The policy outlines the council's position on climate change, acknowledging its impacts and the need for adaptation and mitigation measures. It also sets out long-term aims related to climate change, such as supporting the community, business, and industry to respond to the impacts of a changing climate, and achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for Council operations by 2035. However, these are part of a wider set of responsibilities and actions across multiple themes, including conservation, community engagement and partnerships, and council's responsibilities. Therefore, while climate action is a significant part of the policy, it is not its core purpose or goal.",

      "answer": "The policy does not explicitly state that climate action is the core purpose or goal. While the policy does address aspects related to climate change, such as developing locally specific adaptation responses to climate variability and identifying climate variability impacts and opportunities, it does not clearly establish climate action as its primary objective. The policy also covers other environmental and sustainability issues, such as waste, energy, water, and environmentally sustainable design. Furthermore, the policy outlines a process for developing annual action plans to achieve the goals set out in the strategy, but it does not specify that these goals are primarily focused on climate action. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be definitively stated that climate action is the core purpose or goal of the policy.",

      "answer": "While the policy does address climate action, it is not the core purpose or goal of the policy. The policy is the East Gippsland Shire Council Environmental Sustainability Strategy 2022-2032, and it is built around seven central goals. These goals include conservation of the natural environment and biodiversity, sustainable management of natural resources, community participation in the climate response, respect and alignment with the rights of Traditional Owner Groups, environmental sustainability supporting sustainable economic growth and new job opportunities, growth in the circular economy, and community resilience to respond to increasing climate risk and natural disasters. Climate action is a significant part of the policy, but it is not the sole focus. The policy aims to address a range of environmental and sustainability challenges prevalent across the municipality.",

      "answer": "The policy does not explicitly state that climate action is the core purpose or goal. Instead, it outlines a broader environmental sustainability strategy, of which climate action is a significant part. The policy is built around seven central goals, one of which is 'Community participation in the climate response'. This goal focuses on the extent to which the whole community (local businesses, community organisations, individuals, and Traditional Owners) undertake and participate in the climate response. However, other goals include conservation of the natural environment and biodiversity, sustainable management of natural resources, respect and alignment with the rights of Traditional Owner Groups, and environmental sustainability supporting sustainable economic growth.
