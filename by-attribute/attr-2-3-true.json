      "answer": "The documents indeed call for rapid and urgent action on climate change. The documents highlight the increasing severity of climate change impacts, including more extreme heat waves, fewer frosts, lower average rainfall, more extreme weather events, harsher fire seasons, and shorter snow seasons. The documents also reference the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which states that global warming is occurring faster than previously projected, necessitating immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The local government's Climate Action Plan outlines a commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions from Council operations by July 2023, demonstrating a sense of urgency in their climate action efforts. The plan is set to be reviewed every three years to ensure it remains current with climate science, technology, and community expectations, further emphasizing the need for ongoing, urgent action.",

It is evident from the language used throughout the document that the local government perceives climate change as an immediate and pressing issue that requires swift action. The document refers to the situation as a 'climate emergency', a term that inherently implies urgency. The local government's Climate Emergency Response Plan 2021-2031 is a testament to their commitment to taking immediate action. The plan outlines specific actions, such as integrating climate emergency considerations into all Council decision making, reporting quarterly on progress, and committing to purchasing 100% renewable electricity and becoming a carbon neutral organisation in 2021-22. These actions, coupled with the language used in the document, clearly indicate a call for rapid and urgent action on climate change.",
