The documents outline a comprehensive approach to environmental sustainability, including the inclusion of climate change and sustainability criteria in all relevant documents and policies, and the establishment of six priority areas for action. These areas include biodiversity, built environment, greenhouse gas emissions and energy reduction, healthy waterways, sustainable communities, and waste reduction and resource recovery. However, the documents do not explicitly prioritize these areas above other policy areas. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that a climate emergency response is given higher priority than other policies.",
