The focus of the policy appears to be on reducing emissions and achieving a net-zero target, with actions such as fostering a culture of climate action within the council, establishing a Climate Action Steering Committee, and implementing a cultural change program. The policy also outlines a technical approach to achieving these goals, which includes an emergency scale response and a staged approach to actions. However, these actions are all geared towards mitigation efforts, not adaptation or resilience. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that the plan includes specific actions for climate adaptation and resilience.",

The focus of the documents is primarily on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy efficiency, with specific actions such as retrofitting buildings, investing in renewable energy technology, and improving energy efficiencies. The documents also mention the City of Casey's commitment to reducing emissions in line with national and international targets. However, these actions are mitigation strategies aimed at reducing the impact of climate change, rather than adaptation strategies designed to enhance resilience to the effects of a changing climate. Adaptation strategies typically involve measures such as improving infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events, developing drought-resistant crops, or implementing land-use planning to avoid building in areas at risk of flooding. None of these types of measures are mentioned in the provided documents.",

The documents outline various actions related to environmental sustainability, such as advocating for large-scale renewable energy projects, improving water security and quality, and promoting energy efficiency in vehicle procurement. However, these actions are more related to mitigation strategies and sustainable practices rather than specific adaptation and resilience strategies to a changing climate. It's important to note that while these actions can indirectly contribute to climate resilience, they do not directly address the specific challenges posed by climate change, such as increasing temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise.",
