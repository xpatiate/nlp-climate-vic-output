The Alpine Shire Council's Climate Action Plan aligns with international, federal, state, and regional policies and commitments to mitigate climate change. The Council's commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by July 2023 is clearly stated. The plan outlines a pathway to achieve this target, which includes measures such as reducing corporate emissions, supporting community emissions reduction, and developing a Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan. The plan also includes a commitment to review the document in three years to ensure it remains current with climate science, technology, and community expectations. The Council's approach to climate change mitigation involves a continuous improvement process that is adaptive and responsive to changing needs. This process ensures that the targets set and the means to achieve them are environmentally, financially, and socially sustainable both now and in the future.",
