The policy is designed to address the impacts of climate change and to mitigate the contribution of the council's operations to greenhouse gas emissions. The policy sets a target of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions from council operations by July 2023. It also outlines a pathway of initiatives to achieve this target, including the development of a Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan to ensure the council's assets and the community are prepared for changing weather patterns. The policy also commits to annual monitoring and reporting of emissions, and a review of the target, pathway, and investment strategy in 2024. Therefore, the policy is not only reactive, addressing the impacts of climate change, but also proactive, aiming to mitigate future impacts through emissions reduction and resilience planning.",

The policy also acknowledges the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the local level, as demonstrated by the Council's previous participation in the Cities for Climate Protection Program. Therefore, it is clear that climate action is a central goal of this policy.",

The policy's primary goal is to address the challenges of climate change and to reduce the local government's emissions by 30% by 2020. The policy outlines a Climate Change Action Plan that assesses and explores the impact of climate change on the city's systems, including water supply, transport, communications, energy services, emergency services, and the built environment. The policy also acknowledges the need to look beyond the 2020 target for future emissions reductions. The policy's focus on climate action is further emphasized by its identification of key climate change risks, including less rainfall, more chance of drought, extreme heatwaves and bushfires, more intense rainfall and wind storms, and sea level rise.",
