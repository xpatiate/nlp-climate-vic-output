The City of Ballarat's 'Net' Zero Emissions Plan is designed to be a roadmap for collaborative action, and it outlines how the local government will partner with the community, businesses, and other stakeholders to achieve sustainability. The plan was developed through extensive community engagement and involvement, including the publication and distribution of a background paper, online workshops with stakeholder groups, and face-to-face workshops. These sessions provided a platform for engagement and input, and helped the project team understand community priorities and perspectives on climate action. The plan also includes a review process, with annual reporting on progress and a full review in 2025, which will take into account the success of programs and other factors such as government policy and technology accessibility. This suggests a commitment to ongoing research and adaptation based on community feedback and changing circumstances.",
