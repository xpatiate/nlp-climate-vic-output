While the documents outline a variety of actions to be taken, such as integrating climate into Council operations, robust emissions measurement, ongoing emergency management, waste and landfill emissions reductions, and more, they do not provide a timeline or deadline for when these actions will be implemented or completed. The documents also mention various roles such as leader, supporter, advocate, and funder, and measures such as the number of buildings assessed, reduction in emissions, and number of households participating in programs, but again, no specific timeframes are given for these measures. Therefore, the documents do not provide clear evidence to answer the question in the affirmative.",

While the policy outlines various goals and actions related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, such as integrating climate into Council operations, robust emissions measurement, waste and landfill emissions reductions, and community building improvements, it does not specify when these actions are to be completed. The policy does mention measures for tracking progress, such as the number of buildings assessed and improvements implemented, reduction in emissions, and the number of households participating in programs. However, without a clear timeline for these actions, it is difficult to assess the urgency of action in this policy.",

The documents emphasize the importance of climate change mitigation and the need for community participation in the climate response, but they do not provide a timeline or deadline for these actions. The documents also mention the goal of community participation in the climate response by 2032, but this is a broad goal rather than a specific timeframe for individual actions.",
