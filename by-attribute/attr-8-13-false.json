While the plan does mention that it will be periodically monitored to track progress, it does not detail what specific metrics or indicators will be used to measure the success or failure of its actions. The plan also mentions that it will be reviewed and updated every five years, but it does not specify what criteria will be used to determine whether an update is necessary. The community feedback on the plan also highlights a lack of detailed actions that can be monitored and progress reported regularly. Therefore, without specific, measurable criteria, it is unclear how the local government will evaluate whether its actions are achieving their intended objectives.",
