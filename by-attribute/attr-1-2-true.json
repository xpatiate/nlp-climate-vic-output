They highlight the climate emergency as a significant threat to all life on the planet, with the earth already being too hot due to human activities. The documents underscore the harmful impacts of climate change, including widespread and continuing droughts, frequent floods, heatwaves, and bushfires. They also emphasize the social equity aspect, noting that the most vulnerable people, who have typically made the least contribution to the problem, often have less capacity to respond and cope with the impacts. The documents further stress the need for collective action across all levels of government, businesses, and the community to effectively respond to the climate emergency. They also highlight the community's desire for climate action, with surveys showing that climate change is a leading worry for Australians.",
