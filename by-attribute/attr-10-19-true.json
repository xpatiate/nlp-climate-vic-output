It outlines a plan to deliver targeted assistance to vulnerable households, such as the elderly, rentals, and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities. The policy recognizes that without targeted assistance, these vulnerable groups may miss out on the benefits of climate change action, be unfairly disadvantaged with household costs, and be more exposed to extreme weather. The policy aims to improve social resilience to climate change, reduce energy costs, and increase comfort through low-cost, high-impact housing improvements. It also plans to leverage available state and federal government assistance for housing upgrades. The policy emphasizes fairness and equity, and plans to overcome barriers to change such as language, lack of capital, and not owning their home.",
