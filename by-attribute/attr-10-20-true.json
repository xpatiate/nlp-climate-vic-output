It outlines a plan to deliver targeted financial and advisory services to vulnerable households, such as the elderly, rentals, and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities. The aim is to help these groups respond to climate change impacts, focusing on social connectedness to improve social resilience to climate change, and linking to finance for low-cost, high-impact housing improvements to reduce energy costs and increase comfort. The document acknowledges that without targeted assistance, these vulnerable groups could miss out on the benefits of climate change action and be unfairly disadvantaged with household costs and exposure to extreme weather. The policy also plans to leverage available state and federal government assistance for housing upgrades and link with existing council and other local social services and programs.",

      "answer": "The documents clearly outline the local government's commitment to ensuring that the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate are shared equitably. The policy emphasizes the importance of social inclusion and fairness, with a focus on vulnerable groups such as low-income individuals, the elderly, people with disabilities, and those with diverse cultural backgrounds. The policy also outlines specific considerations for different social factors, such as income inequality and educational background, in its climate change mitigation strategy. For instance, it discusses the impact of energy prices and the upfront cost of installing renewable energy or retrofitting buildings, particularly for renters and those with low income. The policy also highlights the need to develop accessible communication materials to explain programs delivered under the strategy, indicating an effort to ensure that everyone, regardless of their educational background, can understand and access climate change solutions. Therefore, the policy does explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate.",

It emphasizes the concept of 'climate justice', which looks at the climate crisis through a human rights lens. The Merri-bek Human Rights Policy is mentioned as a framework for delivering accessible, equitable, and inclusive programs, services, and decision-making processes.

Therefore, it implies that the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate should be shared equitably. However, the document does not provide specific strategies or actions on how to achieve this equitable distribution. It is also worth noting that the document mentions engaging more deeply to support the community to take individual and collective action, which could be interpreted as an attempt to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to contribute to and benefit from climate action.",
