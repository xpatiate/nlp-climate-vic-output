The City of Ballarat's 'Net Zero Emissions Plan' outlines a strategic direction and a series of actions to reduce emissions, but these actions appear to be based on established practices rather than innovative or experimental approaches. The plan includes actions such as community engagement, cross-sectoral collaboration, and the development of low emissions infrastructure. It also outlines a series of outcomes, including net zero business, homes, new developments, transport, and waste. However, the specific actions to achieve these outcomes are not detailed in the provided documents. The plan does mention the use of workshops and community engagement to develop its strategies, but these are standard practices in policy development rather than innovative or experimental approaches. Therefore, based on the provided documents, the answer to the question is negative.",
