      "answer": "The local government's plan does indeed allocate non-monetary institutional resources to climate action. The plan outlines several actions that involve the mobilisation of staff resources. For instance, the plan includes the implementation of a cultural change program across the Council, which embeds climate action as a responsibility for all staff. This program supports staff to undertake climate action within their own roles. Additionally, the plan establishes a Climate Action Steering Committee to guide the implementation of new climate action projects and foster collaboration between departments. The plan also outlines the development of actions for new priority areas such as waste, business travel, paper use, and water use. These actions will require the involvement and effort of staff across different departments. Therefore, it is clear that the plan does allocate staff and other non-monetary institutional resources to climate action.",

The policy outlines several actions related to climate change, each with a designated responsible department and, in some cases, internal and external partners. For instance, the policy encourages staff and the community to take the Victorian Government’s climate change pledge (Action C18). The Sustainable Assets and Community Relations departments are responsible for this action. Another action (C19) involves staying abreast of the latest research and innovations in Smart City technologies for Council assets and city and infrastructure planning, particularly as they relate to energy and emissions reduction. This action involves multiple departments, including Sustainable Assets, Building and Facilities, Engineering Services, and Capital Works Delivery. These examples demonstrate that the policy not only allocates staff to climate action but also encourages interdepartmental collaboration on these issues.",

For instance, the plan identifies a need for a Sustainability Project Officer position to be made permanent, with an additional operational budget of $21,465 per annum. The plan also proposes the creation of an Energy Projects and Utilities Officer position. Furthermore, the plan outlines various actions to be delivered by existing staff resources, such as the integration of climate change information across all areas of Council’s website and other communication platforms, and the review of the staff induction program to include greater education on sustainability and climate change. Therefore, the plan not only allocates financial resources but also mobilizes institutional resources in the form of staff roles and responsibilities for climate action.",

The plan outlines the need for additional staff resources to implement various actions. For instance, it identifies a need for a permanent Sustainability Project Officer position, and it proposes the creation of an Energy Projects and Utilities Officer position. The plan also allocates existing staff resources to various actions, such as updating the Municipal Emergency Management Plan to better plan for climate change and associated risks, and delivering a coordinated Sustainability in Schools and Kindergartens program. Furthermore, the plan outlines the need for new staff resources for actions such as increasing the uptake of electric vehicles in the community and building capacity within the community for local climate-related projects. Therefore, the plan explicitly allocates both staff and other non-monetary institutional resources to climate action.",

      "answer": "The local government's climate change adaptation plan does allocate staff and other non-monetary institutional resources to climate action. The plan outlines specific actions, their priority, timing, and the responsible department or team. For instance, the plan assigns the 'Planning and Building' department to work with NECMA and CFA to identify a measurable trigger point to review the adequacy of planning scheme mapping. The 'Strategic Asset Management' is tasked with continuing to implement, review, and revise the Stormwater drainage Asset Management Plan considering climate change impacts and sustainability measures. The 'Sustainability' team is responsible for staying abreast of external programs to promote and help fund opportunities for actions. The 'Emergency Response' team is tasked with ongoing review and revision of emergency management/response planning. The plan also mentions that the Director of Business Services, through the Sustainability team, has overall responsibility for the Adaptation Plan and will report progress on implementing the Adaptation Plan to executive level every six months.",

      "answer": "The local government policy does explicitly allocate staff time to climate action. The policy outlines various actions related to climate change, and for each of these actions, it mentions that staff time will be included in the costs. This indicates that the local government is allocating non-monetary institutional resources, specifically staff time, to implement these actions. For instance, the policy mentions the development of strategies and policies, the development of budget bids, and the monitoring of climate change impacts on road maintenance and council buildings as areas where staff time will be allocated. This allocation of staff time is a clear indication of the local government's commitment to addressing climate change and integrating climate considerations into its policy and strategy development processes.",

However, the policy does not provide specific details on the number of staff involved, the amount of time they will spend on these actions, or the specific roles they will play.
