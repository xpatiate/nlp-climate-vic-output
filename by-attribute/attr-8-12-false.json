While the policy outlines a plan for achieving zero net emissions, it does not provide specific sources or data to support its targets or the effectiveness of its proposed actions. The policy mentions the need for climate action and outlines various actions such as creating a climate action culture, zero net emissions buildings, green fleet, low carbon lighting, and maximizing renewable energy. However, it does not provide specific evidence or data to justify these actions or to demonstrate how they will effectively contribute to achieving the stated climate targets. The policy also mentions the use of a monitoring, evaluation, reporting, and improvement (MERI) framework to track progress, but it does not provide details on how this framework will be implemented or how it will ensure the effectiveness of the actions. Therefore, while the policy outlines a plan for climate action, it does not provide well-sourced evidence to justify its targets and actions.",

The documents mention the need for actions such as trialling technologies to reduce the impacts of urban heat, engaging with the community, and building knowledge of climate projections. However, they do not provide specific evidence or sources to justify these actions or to explain how they will effectively address climate change. Furthermore, the documents do not provide clear, measurable targets related to climate change, making it difficult to assess the adequacy of their proposed actions. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that the local government's planned actions are justified by well-sourced evidence.",
