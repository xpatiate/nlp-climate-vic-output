The policy outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change, including mitigation, adaptation, and resilience-building measures. It emphasizes the importance of community engagement, stakeholder collaboration, and advocacy in achieving its climate action goals. The policy also outlines specific actions, such as promoting environmentally sustainable design and partnering with regional and government sectors on climate initiatives. Furthermore, the policy includes a monitoring and evaluation plan to assess the effectiveness of its actions and their environmental outcomes. This comprehensive approach to climate action, coupled with the specific actions and monitoring plan, strongly suggests that climate action is the core purpose of this policy.",

Climate change impacts will increasingly impact on Council services. High fire danger days and extreme rainfall events are already impacting when it is safe for Council officers to work outdoors or travel to different parts of the Shire to deliver services. Maintaining and growing green open spaces is challenging in a hotter and drier climate, and drainage infrastructure has difficulty coping with more flooding and higher intensity rain events. The demand on Council services will change and increase because of climate impacts.",

          "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the documents do mention community engagement, collaboration, and education as part of the climate change action plan, they do not specifically address the equitable distribution of benefits and opportunities. The documents focus more on the actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change, such as developing an Environmental Sustainability Strategy, prioritising climate change actions, and advocating for Environmentally Sustainable Design (ESD). However, these actions are not directly linked to the equitable sharing of benefits and opportunities. Therefore, based on the provided documents, the question cannot be answered in the affirmative."
