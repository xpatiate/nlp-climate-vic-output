The objectives of the plan include leading the community and businesses to build resilience and proactively consider climate risk, and working with key financial partners to increase consideration of climate risk. The policy also outlines specific actions to be taken, such as facilitating improved community resilience, developing an Integrated Water Plan, and investigating modifications of construction practices for road and council infrastructure. Each action includes details of relevant risks, timelines, action ownership, resources required, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)."
