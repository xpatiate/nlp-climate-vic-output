The policy is designed to address the impacts of climate change on the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of the local area. It outlines objectives such as mainstreaming climate risk considerations and adaptation actions in Council policies, programs, and service delivery, and identifying action pathways to increase the adaptive capacity and foster timely opportunities to strengthen climate change resilience across the shire. The policy also includes a 10-year costed action plan to address the most urgent climate risks. The policy's purpose is not only to mitigate the effects of climate change but also to ensure that the community is resilient and sustainable in the face of these challenges.",

They highlight that climate change is a global challenge caused by the increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels. The documents underscore that these activities have led to global warming and climate change, with localised impacts that have adverse effects on social, economic, and environmental systems. The documents further emphasise that adapting to these changes requires taking actions to lessen the adverse consequences of climate change. The documents also outline specific objectives and action plans to address climate change, including raising community awareness, identifying high-risk areas for development, and advocating for climate change adaptation initiatives.

The plan outlines a series of actions to be taken over a 10-year period, with each action associated with a specific timeframe, lead partner, and funding allocation. For instance, the plan includes the creation of a 'Climate Resilience Officer' role, with operational funding allocated for this position. Other actions, such as raising community awareness, identifying high-risk areas for development, and advocating for climate change adaptation initiatives, also have specific funding allocations.

Furthermore, the plan includes actions such as 'Raise community awareness and increase preparedness for climate hazards', 'Identify high-risk areas for development and develop resources to assist the community', and 'Provide support for staff directly affected by climate hazard events or involved in relief and recovery efforts'. These actions suggest that the local government is not only allocating staff to climate action but also investing in training and support for these staff members.

          "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities in the context of 'equity and social justice'. While the documents do mention the need for climate change adaptation measures, the identification of climate risks, and the development of action plans to address these risks, they do not specifically address the differential impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities. The documents focus more on general community preparedness, organisational resilience, and the inclusion of climate change adaptation measures in council policies. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be affirmed that the documents discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities in terms of equity and social justice."

          "answer": "The documents provided do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the documents do outline various strategies and actions related to climate change adaptation, these primarily focus on identifying and mitigating climate risks, increasing resilience, and implementing specific programs or initiatives. There is no explicit mention of how these actions will ensure the equitable distribution of benefits and opportunities. Furthermore, there is no specific discussion on how social justice will be addressed in the context of climate change adaptation. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that there is an explicit discussion on how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate."
