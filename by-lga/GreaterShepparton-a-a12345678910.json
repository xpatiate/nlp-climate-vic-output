          "answer": "The policy's core purpose is indeed climate action. The policy is structured around four strategic priorities, all of which are directly related to climate change. These priorities include demonstrating climate change leadership, accelerating the transition to net zero emissions communities, building a climate-resilient community, and supporting a thriving, climate-smart local agricultural sector. The policy outlines specific actions to be taken in each of these areas, such as increasing public awareness of climate change impacts, promoting knowledge sharing on energy-efficient and renewable energy technology, and supporting best-practice sustainable agricultural policies. The policy also emphasizes the importance of community involvement and partnership in achieving these goals. Therefore, it is clear that the policy's primary goal is to drive climate action across the community and support the transition to a more sustainable and resilient future."
