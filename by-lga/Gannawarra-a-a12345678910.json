          "answer": "The core purpose of the policy, as stated in the document, is indeed climate action. The policy is designed to provide the Council with a strategic framework for mitigating and adapting to climate change. This is achieved through a variety of strategies, including reducing environmental impacts and operating costs, transitioning to renewable energy, and achieving net zero emissions by specific target dates. The policy also aims to reduce community emissions and increase public engagement, education, and action on climate change. Furthermore, the policy outlines plans to respond to the risks of climate change to Council assets and services and assist the community in becoming more resilient to the effects of climate change. Therefore, it is clear that the primary goal of the policy is to address climate change through a variety of strategic actions."

It acknowledges the scientific evidence and the risk that climate change presents to the community and the planet. The policy outlines the council's strategic framework for mitigating and adapting to climate change, with objectives such as reducing environmental impacts and operating costs, transitioning to 100% renewable energy, and achieving net zero emissions by certain deadlines. The policy also emphasizes the need for community engagement, education, and action to reduce emissions. Furthermore, it recognizes the vulnerability of the Gannawarra region to the adverse effects of climate change and the necessity for early measures to increase resilience. The policy also highlights the potential for the region to become a top renewable energy producing municipality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and shifting to 100% renewables."

While the policy outlines a strategic framework for mitigating and adapting to climate change, it does not use language that conveys a sense of urgency or immediacy. The policy includes plans for transitioning to 100% renewable energy and achieving net zero emissions by specific dates (2025 for corporate emissions and 2040 for landfill emissions), as well as reducing community emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieving net zero by 2040. However, these are long-term goals and the policy does not emphasize the need for immediate action. The policy also mentions the development of new procedures and resources, regular reviews of strategies and plans, and the integration of climate change adaptation and mitigation principles into existing policies and decision-making processes. Again, these actions are important but do not convey a sense of urgency."

It outlines a strategic framework for mitigating and adapting to climate change, with clear deadlines for achieving certain goals. For instance, the policy aims to transition to 100% renewable energy and achieve corporate net zero emissions by 2025. It also sets a goal for net zero emissions at the Landfill by 2040. Furthermore, the policy outlines actions to support the community towards achieving a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2040. These specific timeframes indicate a sense of urgency in the policy's approach to addressing climate change. However, it is important to note that the success of these goals will depend on the implementation and enforcement of the strategies outlined in the policy."

However, these actions are not backed by well-sourced evidence. The policy does not cite any scientific studies, data, or expert opinions to justify these actions or to demonstrate that they will effectively address the challenges of climate change.
