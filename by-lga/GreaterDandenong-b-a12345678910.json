The policy outlines a comprehensive plan for the local government to respond to climate change, with a focus on both mitigation and adaptation strategies. The policy includes specific actions, roles, timeframes, responsibilities, outcomes, and indicators, demonstrating a high level of detail and commitment to addressing climate change. The policy also emphasizes the need for community engagement and education, indicating a holistic approach to climate action. The policy's commitment to climate action is further demonstrated by its intention to embed consideration of climate change into the development of the Council’s 2021–25 Council Plan and supporting strategic documents. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is the core purpose of this policy."

The plan also emphasizes the need to embed consideration of climate change into the development of Council’s 2021–25 Council Plan and supporting strategic documents. The documents also highlight the need to increase awareness within the community and within the council about the risks and impacts of climate change. The council also plans to seek external funding grants to increase local biodiversity and the urban forest, indicating a proactive approach to addressing climate change."

This is to drive emergency action to reduce greenhouse gases in line with global efforts to keep global warming below 1.5oC. This priority is emphasized as a key priority in the next Council Plan. The documents also detail the specific actions, roles, and responsibilities of the Council in addressing the climate emergency, further emphasizing its prioritization.

These resources are often described as 'Within anticipated operational budgets' or 'Within existing operational budgets', indicating that funding has been allocated for these actions. For instance, the policy mentions the development of a Climate Change Community Engagement & Mobilisation Plan, which is to be funded from existing operational budgets. Another example is the incorporation of vulnerability assessments into the council's existing Asset Management Processes, which has a budget of $50,000 in 2021/22.
