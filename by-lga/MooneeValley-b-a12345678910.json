The policy outlines a comprehensive plan to address climate change, with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diverting waste from landfill, protecting and recycling valuable drinking water supplies, enhancing the urban environment and ecology, and keeping the city green and cool. The policy also acknowledges the climate emergency and is designed to accelerate sustained and meaningful action by all levels of government. It sets targets for Council’s operations, including achieving zero net carbon emissions from Council operations by 2020 and zero net emissions for the community by 2040. The policy also includes specific actions such as undertaking mapping and analysis of urban heat island effects, encouraging community members to improve tree canopy cover, and developing an internal Council program to respond to the climate emergency.",
