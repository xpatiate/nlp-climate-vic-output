The policy is designed to guide strategies, evaluate and assess projects and policies, and enable the Council to manage its climate change vulnerability, thereby increasing the organisationâ€™s resilience and preparation for the future. The policy's objectives include reducing greenhouse gas emissions through appropriate mitigation strategies, applying risk management to develop adaptation strategies, conserving natural resources, and evaluating the climate change implications when making strategic and operational decisions. The policy also applies to Council services and assets and is to be considered when Council and its officers make recommendations. The policy is supported by a Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan, which outlines specific actions to be taken to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change."

The local government recognizes the severity of climate change and understands that adaptation planning is fundamental to mitigating the adverse impacts associated with it. The Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan (CCAAP) is presented as a demonstration of the council's actions to adapt and mitigate the impacts of climate change. The plan is designed to reduce the vulnerability of the council's assets and services, while empowering the community to be healthy, connected, and resilient. The council has used an evidence-based approach for the development of the CCAAP, prioritizing actions based on climate risks and opportunities specific to their local region. The documents also highlight the legislative responsibilities of local governments to incorporate climate risk mitigation and adaptation actions into all operations."
