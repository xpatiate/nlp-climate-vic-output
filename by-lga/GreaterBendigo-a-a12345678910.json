          "answer": "The policy under review, the 'Climate Change and Environment Strategy', clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy is designed to address climate change and environmental sustainability, as evidenced by its title and the content of the documents. The policy outlines a strategy that incorporates the 'One Planet Living principles' of 'Health and happiness', 'Equity and local economy', and 'Culture and community', all of which are intrinsically linked to climate action. The policy also acknowledges the need for 'environmental sustainability (including climate change risk)' to be promoted. Furthermore, the policy outlines specific action areas and goals related to climate change, such as 'Zero carbon' and 'Biodiversity and regeneration'. The policy also mentions the establishment of a 'Climate and Environment Working Group' to support implementation and collaboration across the organization. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is the core purpose of this policy."

The document also refers to a report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), which found that the health of ecosystems is deteriorating more rapidly than ever before, eroding the foundations of human economies, livelihoods, food security, health, and quality of life. The document further outlines the City of Greater Bendigo's response, which includes a strategy designed to support action to restore and regenerate ecosystems and mitigate against climate change through reducing carbon emissions and sequestering carbon. This strategy also includes action to adapt to climate change, with the document stating that by adapting early, we can reduce our exposure to climate risks."
