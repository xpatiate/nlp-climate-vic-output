The policy's principal purpose is to outline the local government's position on the climate emergency, with the aim of orientating social transformation. The policy aims to lead the community to zero net emissions in accordance with climate science and position the climate emergency as the strategic focus of Council operations. The policy also acknowledges the 21st century as a period of climate emergency and opportunity for positive social change. The policy's action plan includes actions that the Council can control, partner, and advocate for that affect the climate emergency and transition to the net zero emission resilient economy. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is the core purpose of the policy.",

For instance, the 'Climate Change Adaptation Framework' document mentions the Western Alliance for Greenhouse Action, a partnership with RMIT Centre for Urban Research and the Net Balance Foundation, which produced a monitoring, evaluation, and reporting (ME&R) framework for adaptation performance. The document also refers to collaborations with other emergency management agencies, VicRoads, and other councils. Furthermore, the document mentions the 'Resilient Melbourne’s Neighbourhood project' as a potential opportunity for community strengthening programs that support climate resilience. These partnerships and collaborations are crucial for the local government to effectively address climate change at the local level."

          "answer": "The documents explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. The Brimbank Climate Emergency Plan 2020-2025 and the Brimbank Climate Change Adaptation Framework both highlight the importance of equity and social justice in their climate change policies. The documents emphasize that the impacts of climate change are felt first and foremost by those already most vulnerable in the community, including the elderly, the very young, the poor, and those with existing medical and mental health conditions. The documents also outline plans to ensure that these vulnerable groups are not disproportionately affected by climate change. This includes providing them with appropriate information, opportunities to be involved, and adequate public consultation. The documents also mention plans to develop and deliver educational programs to raise awareness of climate impacts and how to prepare for them, which will assist in reducing pressure on emergency management resources over time.",

          "positive": true,
          "answer": "The documents do discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate. The Brimbank Climate Emergency Plan 2020-2025 outlines the principle of equity in decision-making, aiming to create opportunities for both present and future generations to adapt to climate change. This is particularly targeted towards those most vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change. The plan emphasizes maintaining or enhancing the health, diversity, and productivity of the environment for the benefit of future generations. The principle of community engagement also ensures that the community, including youth, the vulnerable, or marginalized communities, are involved in decisions that may affect them. The plan also mentions the concept of 'environmental equity', which considers the unity of environmental, social, and economic factors of climate change. This is used to inform the co-creation of a zero net emissions, resilient city. Therefore, the documents do provide a clear framework for equitably sharing the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate.",
