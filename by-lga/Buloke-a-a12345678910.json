The policy outlines a series of goals and actions aimed at integrating climate considerations into council operations, reducing emissions, managing waste and landfill emissions, improving council and community buildings, and enhancing energy security. The policy also includes measures for low emission transport, transport infrastructure improvements, and septic tank management. These actions are all aimed at mitigating and adapting to climate change, which is the central purpose of the policy. The policy also includes measures for monitoring and reporting on the impacts of climate change on council services, further emphasizing its focus on climate action.",
