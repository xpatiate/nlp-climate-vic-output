          "answer": "The policy under review, the Strathbogie 2022 Climate Change Action Plan, clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy is structured around five main areas of action, all of which are directly related to climate change: protecting the natural environment, reducing emissions, building a climate-resilient community, moving sustainably, and advocating for change. The policy outlines specific actions within these areas, such as advocating for local net zero emissions community energy solutions, establishing a Climate Action Steering Committee, and setting a goal of net zero emissions by 2025 for Council operations. The policy also emphasizes the importance of partnerships between the Council, residents, businesses, farmers, and community groups in driving climate action. Therefore, it is evident that the core purpose of this policy is to guide and promote climate action at the local level.",

          "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the documents do outline various actions and strategies related to climate change, such as promoting environmental sustainability, advocating for change, and incorporating climate change considerations into council planning and decision-making, there is no specific mention of how these actions will ensure equitable distribution of benefits and opportunities. The documents also do not provide any specific measures or strategies aimed at promoting social justice in the context of climate change. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that the local government policy explicitly discusses how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate."
