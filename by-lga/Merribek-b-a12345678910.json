          "answer": "The policy under review, titled 'Zero Carbon Merri-bek – Climate Emergency Action Plan 2020/21 – 2024/25', clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy outlines a comprehensive plan to address climate change, with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to a zero-carbon society. The policy acknowledges the climate emergency and outlines a series of actions and initiatives aimed at mobilising the community, businesses, and government to respond to this crisis. These actions include facilitating community food gardens, installing electric vehicle charging stations, and advocating for state and federal governments to enact key policies for a zero-carbon transition. The policy also sets a goal for Merri-bek to achieve a 75% emissions reduction by 2030. Therefore, it is evident that the core purpose of this policy is climate action.",

The documents primarily focus on mitigation strategies such as reducing carbon emissions, community mobilisation and advocacy, and behaviour change initiatives. While these actions are crucial in addressing climate change, they do not directly address adaptation and resilience to the impacts of a changing climate. Adaptation strategies typically involve measures to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to observed or expected changes in climate, such as developing infrastructure to cope with increased flood risk or implementing strategies to manage heat stress.

The documents also mention the goal of achieving 75 per cent emissions reduction by 2030, but do not provide a clear rationale or evidence-based justification for this specific target.

The plan outlines a clear goal for the city of Merri-bek to achieve a 75 per cent emissions reduction by 2030. This is a quantifiable target that can be measured and tracked over time. The plan also includes specific actions and programs, such as facilitating community food gardens, installing electric vehicle charging stations, and piloting community-owned solar energy systems. Each of these actions can be evaluated based on their implementation and impact. For instance, the number of charging stations installed or the amount of food produced by community gardens can be measured. Furthermore, the plan mentions the use of a staff survey to measure the integration of climate action within their service area, strategies, and policies.
