          "answer": "The policy does not explicitly state that climate action is the core purpose or goal. Instead, it outlines a broader environmental sustainability strategy, of which climate action is a significant part. The policy is built around seven central goals, one of which is 'Community participation in the climate response'. This goal focuses on the extent to which the whole community (local businesses, community organisations, individuals, and Traditional Owners) undertake and participate in the climate response. However, other goals include conservation of the natural environment and biodiversity, sustainable management of natural resources, respect and alignment with the rights of Traditional Owner Groups, and environmental sustainability supporting sustainable economic growth. Therefore, while climate action is a key aspect of the policy, it is not the sole or core purpose."
