          "answer": "The Central Goldfields Climate Action Plan is indeed centered around climate action as its core purpose. The policy outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change, including both mitigation and adaptation strategies. Mitigation strategies aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while adaptation strategies prepare for unavoidable changes to the climate. The policy identifies six priority areas for action: Education, Collaboration & Mobilisation, Health & Wellbeing, Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency, Built Environment & Transport, Waste & the Circular Economy, and Land & Water. The policy also emphasizes the importance of community engagement and collaboration in achieving its climate action goals. It outlines specific actions to be taken in the initial two years of the plan, demonstrating a commitment to immediate action.",

          "answer": "The document does explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. It outlines the local government's commitment to supporting groups most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including the elderly, people living with disabilities, culturally and linguistically diverse populations, females, and LGBTIQ+ communities. The policy also acknowledges the need to support outdoor workers, farmers, and those living in fire or flood-prone areas. The document further emphasizes the importance of climate adaptation and emissions reduction in its decision-making and operations. It also highlights the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the health and wellbeing of the community, including the potential for increased infectious diseases and mental health impacts such as climate anxiety. The policy's focus on equity and social justice is evident in its commitment to ensuring that its climate action supports those most at risk.",

          "answer": "The policy document does discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate. It emphasizes the importance of supporting vulnerable groups in climate action, including the elderly, people living with disabilities, and diverse cultural and gender groups. The policy also outlines plans to develop a climate-focused education program and to support the establishment of a community energy group to facilitate renewable energy opportunities. These actions suggest an intention to distribute climate benefits and opportunities across the community. However, the document does not provide specific details on how these benefits and opportunities will be equitably shared. It is also unclear how the policy will ensure that these actions are implemented in a way that is fair and just.",
