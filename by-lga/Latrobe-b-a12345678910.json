          "answer": "The core purpose of the policy, as outlined in the documents, is to position the Latrobe City for a low carbon emissions future. The policy was adopted in response to the Australian Government's proposed carbon emissions pricing mechanism, and the local government took a proactive approach to address the challenges and opportunities presented by this scheme. The policy is underpinned by three themes, one of which is pursuing and realizing opportunities for a smooth and successful transition to a low carbon emissions future. The policy contains 30 actions, 11 of which are considered complete, with 18 ongoing and one superseded by other initiatives. The policy's development was collaborative, involving stakeholder consultation and interactive workshops. The policy's effectiveness was assessed against the Victorian Government’s White Paper on Climate Change actions and objectives and was found to be relevant and complementary.",

The local government's policy, 'Positioning Latrobe City for a Low Carbon Emissions Future', was adopted in 2010 with the aim of transitioning to a low carbon economy. The policy was developed in response to the Australian Government's consideration of a price on carbon emissions, which would directly affect the local community due to its intensive brown coal energy generation industry. The policy was designed to proactively address the challenges and opportunities presented by a proposed carbon emissions pricing scheme. The policy contains 30 actions, 11 of which are considered complete, with 18 ongoing and one superseded by other initiatives. The policy's effectiveness is underscored by the fact that it was found to be relevant and complementary to the previous Victorian Government’s White Paper on Climate Change.",
