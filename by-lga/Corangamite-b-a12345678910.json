While the policy does address aspects related to climate change, such as developing locally specific adaptation responses to climate variability and identifying climate variability impacts and opportunities, these are presented as part of a broader environmental and sustainability strategy. The policy also includes goals related to waste, energy, water, environmentally sustainable design, and transport. Furthermore, the policy outlines a process for developing annual action plans to achieve the goals set out in the strategy, but it does not specify that these goals are primarily focused on climate action. Therefore, it can be inferred that while climate action is a significant component of the policy, it is not the core purpose or goal."

The policy also mentions strategies to engage staff on environmentally sustainable initiatives across various sub-areas such as waste, energy, water, Environmentally Sustainable Design (ESD), and transport. These strategies are expected to benefit staff through increased efficiencies, reduced costs, healthier work environments, and more social interaction with colleagues across the organization.
