The policy is a broader Environment Strategy, and climate action is one of the key themes within it. The policy outlines the council's position on climate change, acknowledging its impacts and the need for adaptation and mitigation measures. It also sets out long-term aims related to climate change, such as supporting the community, business, and industry to respond to the impacts of a changing climate, and achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for Council operations by 2035. However, these are part of a wider set of responsibilities and actions across multiple themes, including conservation, community engagement and partnerships, and council's responsibilities. Therefore, while climate action is a significant part of the policy, it is not its core purpose or goal."

          "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the documents do outline the local government's plans and actions towards climate change mitigation and adaptation, they do not specifically address the distribution of benefits and opportunities in an equitable manner. The documents focus on the council's responsibilities, long-term aims, performance indicators, and example actions related to climate change, but these do not directly relate to equity and social justice. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that there is a clear plan or policy on how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate."
