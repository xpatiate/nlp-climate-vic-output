The policy is governed by the implementation of a new Climate Action Plan, which will be developed with extensive internal and community consultation. This plan includes emissions reduction targets and pathways for the Council, as well as detailed and concrete actions to be undertaken for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The policy also emphasizes the need to broaden the focus on both adaptation and mitigation, and the Local Government Act 2020 mandates that the Council must promote mitigation and planning for climate change risks. Furthermore, the policy acknowledges the challenges of adapting to the changing climate and mitigating the municipality's impact on the environment by reducing emissions. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is a central goal of the policy.",

However, the language used does not convey a sense of urgency or immediacy.
