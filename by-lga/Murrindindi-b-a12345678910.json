The policy is structured around four central goals, all of which are directly related to addressing climate change. These goals include developing internal knowledge and systems to consider climate change in decision making, achieving net zero emissions by 2035, minimizing the impacts of climate change on Councilâ€™s infrastructure and services, and inspiring and scaling up climate action across the municipality and through other levels of government. The policy also outlines specific targets and strategic directions to achieve these goals, further emphasizing its commitment to climate action. The policy is designed to be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changing conditions and community priorities, demonstrating a sustained commitment to climate action over time.",

While the documents do mention the impacts of climate change on the community and the local government's efforts to mitigate these impacts, they do not specifically address how these impacts might disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. The documents also do not discuss measures to ensure equity and social justice in the local government's climate change policies or actions. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that the local government policy explicitly discusses the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities in terms of equity and social justice."

While the documents do outline various actions and strategies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, such as community development programs, direct resourcing and support for climate mitigation activities, and the development of Environmentally Sustainable Design guidelines, they do not specifically address the equitable distribution of benefits and opportunities. Furthermore, there is no explicit mention of social justice in relation to climate change actions. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that the policy discusses how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate."
