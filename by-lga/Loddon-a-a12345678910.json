The policy, titled 'Environmental Sustainability Strategy Action Plan 2013-2018', does encompass aspects of environmental sustainability, but it does not explicitly state that climate action is its primary focus. The policy includes various strategic directions and actions, such as advocating for renewable energy projects, incorporating educational material on environmental sustainability, and considering energy efficiency in procurement processes. However, these actions seem to be part of a broader sustainability strategy rather than a focused climate action plan. The policy also includes strategic platforms and core business elements that cover a wide range of areas, from building strong communities to economic development, indicating a broad scope beyond climate action."

It also mentions incorporating educational material on environmental sustainability on the Council's new website in 2014. Another action, the investigation of the opportunity to employ an environmental sustainability officer within the Council, is slated for 2015-2016. These examples demonstrate that the document provides clear and specific timeframes for its planned actions related to climate change.",

The policy outlines several actions related to environmental sustainability, some of which have budget allocations. For instance, the policy includes a plan to maintain a car pool policy with a budget of $5,000 (T2). Additionally, the policy outlines a plan to upgrade street lighting to high-efficiency technology with a budget of $80,000 (E7). However, it's worth noting that many of the actions listed in the policy do not have a specified budget, instead listing 'NIL' as the budget. This could indicate that these actions are expected to be carried out with existing resources or that the budget will be determined at a later date. Therefore, while the policy does allocate some funding for climate action, the extent and specifics of this funding are not entirely clear.",

For instance, the 'Plant Replacement committee' is tasked with incorporating energy efficiency assessments into their procurement recommendations (T1). The CEO is responsible for maintaining a carpool policy (T2), and the review of the vehicle policy to encourage energy-efficient vehicles is also mentioned (T3).

The policy outlines several actions that involve community engagement and education. For instance, the policy recommends incorporating educational or informative material on the Council's new website, including links to external agency websites, relating to opportunities for the improvement or enhancement of environmental sustainability within local households and businesses. This action suggests an effort to educate the community about environmental sustainability and provide them with resources to take action. Additionally, the policy advocates for business opportunities for large-scale renewable energy projects within the municipality and encourages collaboration with neighbouring municipalities. This action could potentially mobilize businesses and other stakeholders in the community to work together on renewable energy projects.

The plan outlines several actions related to sustainable transport and energy management. For instance, it recommends the Plant Replacement committee to consider energy efficiency in their procurement processes, which could lead to the purchase of more energy-efficient vehicles or equipment. This is a technological solution that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The plan also suggests reviewing the vehicle policy to encourage the choice of energy-efficient vehicles in employment packages, which could influence behaviour change. Furthermore, the plan advocates for large-scale renewable energy projects within the municipality, another technological solution that could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
