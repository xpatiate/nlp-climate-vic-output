The policy is designed to manage the risks of a changing climate, maximise positive outcomes, and build the resilience of the City of Melton. It provides a formal and coordinated climate change adaptation framework and action plan for the future. The policy is organised into five themes: Community Wellbeing and Emergency Management, Open Space and Water Security, Assets and Infrastructure, Planning, Buildings and Regulations, and Governance and Risk. Each theme contains specific actions to address climate change impacts. The policy also outlines strategies to improve understanding of climate change-related exposure to legal and financial risk, integrate climate change considerations into relevant plans, policies and processes, and monitor climate change impacts on Council service delivery and operations. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is the core purpose of this policy.",

They outline a comprehensive Climate Change Adaptation Plan, which is a response to current and anticipated future changes due to climate change. The plan is designed to reduce the local government's own contribution to climate change, achieve net zero emissions by 2040, and adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change. The documents highlight that climate change will affect most areas of council operations, services, and functions, and therefore, it is important to embed climate change considerations in relevant strategies and plans. The documents also emphasize the need to update existing strategies, policies, and processes to embed climate change adaptation considerations. The plan includes specific actions, such as improving understanding of climate change related exposure to legal and financial risk, integrating climate change considerations in relevant plans, policies, and processes, and monitoring climate change impacts on Council service delivery and operations.",

These actions are further categorized into short-term (0-3 years), medium-term (4-6 years), and long-term (7+ years) priorities. The document also mentions that ongoing priorities are those that may already be occurring and are expected to continue into the future.

The 'Environment and Waste' unit is assigned to establish a process for monitoring, evaluating, and reporting on climate change impacts on Council service delivery and operations. The 'Risk and Performance' unit is responsible for improving the ability to respond to extreme weather events through understanding current emergency response capacity.
