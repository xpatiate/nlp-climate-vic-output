The documents also outline the local government's moral and legal obligations to adapt to the impacts of climate change and work towards reducing emissions. However, there is no specific language used that would indicate a call for immediate or urgent action. The documents focus more on the need for strategic planning, mitigation, and adaptation, and the importance of considering climate change risks in decision-making processes.
