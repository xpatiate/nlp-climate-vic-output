Additionally, the council aims to review and update key decision-making tools to ensure capital works projects undertake climate change assessments early in the development stage and apply to project planning and delivery in the 2020/21 timeframe. Furthermore, the council plans to update the Municipal Emergency Management Plan in line with the new Emergency Management Legislation Amendment Act 2018 in the 2021/22 timeframe.

The policy outlines several actions related to climate change, such as updating emergency management plans, reviewing council policies for climate adaptation opportunities, and investigating the long-term costs of climate change. For each of these actions, the policy states that they will be resourced 'Within existing resources'. This suggests that the local government has allocated resources, potentially including funding, for these actions. However, the policy does not provide specific details about the amount of funding allocated or the source of this funding.

Furthermore, the policy outlines the council's role in developing and delivering training packages for appropriate council staff to build climate change adaptation awareness and risk assessment into programs and services.
