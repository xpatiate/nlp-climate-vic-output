The ME&R framework includes indicator sets under two themes: 'community wellbeing and emergency management' and 'open space and water security'. These indicators cover areas such as knowledge of service vulnerability or resilience to climate change impacts, organisational capacity to plan for and respond to the impacts, and adequate resourcing to meet adaptation requirements. The plan also mentions the use of the Global Reporting Initiative as a potential reporting framework.

This includes heat mapping to understand the areas most vulnerable to increased temperatures. Another action involves investigating options that model the impact of future climate scenarios on indigenous flora and fauna. This research will help the local government make informed decisions about how to protect local ecosystems from the impacts of climate change.

          "answer": "The documents clearly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities, emphasizing the need for equity and social justice in climate change policies. The Brimbank Climate Emergency Plan 2020-2025 outlines the principle of equity, stating that decision-making will create opportunities for both the present and future generations to adapt to climate change, particularly for those most vulnerable to its potential impacts. The plan also emphasizes the need for community engagement, including involvement from vulnerable or marginalized communities. The Climate Change Adaptation Framework 2017-2022 also highlights the need to protect vulnerable community members from the impact of heatwaves, flooding, and frequency and severity of storm events. It also mentions that Brimbank has a high proportion of residents who are at increased risk to climate change impacts due to socio-economic disadvantage, being a recent migrant, elderly or very young, or due to having a chronic health condition.",

          "answer": "The documents do discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate. The Brimbank Climate Emergency Plan 2020-2025 outlines the principle of equity in decision-making, aiming to create opportunities for both present and future generations to adapt to climate change. This is particularly targeted towards those most vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change. The plan also emphasizes community engagement, involving the community in decisions that may affect them and providing them with appropriate information and opportunities to be involved. The plan also mentions the concept of 'environmental equity', which considers the unity of environmental, social, and economic factors of climate change. This is used to inform the co-creation of a zero net emissions, resilient city. The plan also outlines actions to be taken to ensure the health, diversity, and productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations.",
