          "answer": "The core purpose of the policy, as indicated by the documents, is indeed climate action. The policy is titled 'Zero Net Carbon Action Plan – 2020-2025', which suggests a clear focus on reducing carbon emissions and addressing climate change. The policy outlines a number of actions aimed at mitigating the impacts of climate change, such as updating the Environmental Sustainable Development policy to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, developing a climate adaptation strategy, and investing in infrastructure upgrades to reduce energy use. The policy also includes measures to educate staff and the community about climate change and how to achieve carbon neutrality. Furthermore, the policy aims to align adaptation approaches with a zero net emission approach, including the development of an urban forest to reduce heat island effects. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is the core purpose of this policy."
