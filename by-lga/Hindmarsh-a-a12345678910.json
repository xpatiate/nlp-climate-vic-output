The policy aims to help the Council and stakeholders understand the impacts of climate change in the region, identify the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and reduced water availability, clarify the Council's role and scope for action on these issues, and identify measures the Council can adopt to address risks and act on opportunities. The policy focuses on the impact of climate change and reduced water availability across four main themes: the regional economy, utilities infrastructure, community infrastructure, and the Council's capacity to meet the needs of its community as the climate and water availability changes. The policy also outlines specific actions for the Council to take in preparation for climate change and reduced water availability, such as advocating for ongoing research and development to assist the agricultural industry adapt to the changing climate.",

This includes areas such as stormwater drainage capacity maintenance, road construction and design, and building maintenance, upgrade, and design. The policy also mentions the need for community engagement, which would likely involve staff resources. Furthermore, the policy discusses the need to regularly update and consider climate change and water availability scenarios in the analysis of future asset management plans and broader council planning.
