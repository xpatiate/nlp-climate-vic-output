The policy outlines a comprehensive plan to address the climate emergency, with a focus on mobilizing the community, accelerating renewable energy, creating a climate-adapted city, transitioning to zero emissions transport, and moving towards zero waste. The policy also includes specific actions such as delivering a new climate program, committing substantial grant funds to stimulate community-driven climate action, and upgrading homes to be more energy efficient and climate resilient. The policy aims to engage 10,000 people in Yarra to take action on the climate emergency by 2024. The policy also acknowledges the need for advocacy, with the council planning to partner with others in the community to jointly push for other levels of governments to respond to the climate emergency at the scale and speed the crisis requires.",

They highlight the climate emergency as a significant threat to all life on the planet, with the earth already being too hot due to human activities. The documents underscore the harmful impacts of climate change, including widespread and continuing droughts, frequent floods, heatwaves, and bushfires. They also emphasize the social equity aspect, noting that the most vulnerable people, who have typically made the least contribution to the problem, often have less capacity to respond and cope with the impacts. The documents further stress the need for collective action across all levels of government, businesses, and the community to effectively respond to the climate emergency.

For instance, the plan commits to dedicating a substantial pool of community grant funds to accelerate community-led climate action. It also mentions the allocation of funds for the implementation of new initiatives and the expansion of existing ones. However, it should be noted that the plan also indicates that some actions will be delivered within existing resources or with a modest increase in resources, and that full costed project proposals and schedules will be prepared at a later time and be subject to future budget approval processes. Therefore, while the plan does allocate funding for climate action, the specifics of this funding are not always clearly defined."

The plan outlines a variety of actions that involve the mobilisation of existing resources and staff to address climate change. For instance, the plan mentions the delivery of community programs to accelerate climate action, which would require staff involvement. It also mentions the development of an Integrated Water Management Plan, which would require the use of existing institutional resources. Furthermore, the plan discusses the need to embed climate resilience into all of Yarra Council’s work and support staff to understand the climate emergency and to deliver climate responses as part of their roles. This indicates a clear allocation of staff resources towards climate action. However, it should be noted that while the plan does allocate resources, it also mentions that there are budget constraints due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may affect the extent of resource allocation."
