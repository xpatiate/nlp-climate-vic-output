While the policy does include actions related to climate change, such as developing an appropriate mechanism to measure greenhouse gas emissions, facilitating community efforts to adapt to climate change, and encouraging the construction of energy-efficient buildings, these actions are part of a broader set of goals and tasks. The policy also addresses other issues such as building maintenance, property management, and stakeholder relationships.

While the policy does outline long-term goals, intermediate outcomes, and evaluation questions, it does not provide specific, measurable criteria against which the success of these actions can be evaluated. For example, the policy states an objective to 'achieve self-sustaining communities through increasing their liveability, including health and wellbeing, by enhancing their economic, social and environmental capacity.' However, it does not provide specific, measurable criteria for what constitutes a 'self-sustaining community' or 'increased liveability.' Similarly, the policy outlines an intermediate outcome to 'utilise the Transition Town Toolkit and other resources to prepare and develop community plans,' but does not provide specific, measurable criteria for what successful utilisation of these resources would look like.
