While the policy does address climate-related issues, it does so as part of a broader environmental sustainability strategy. The policy outlines objectives and actions under six key themes: Education and Awareness, Water Quality & Water Conservation, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Waste Management Practices, Biodiversity Management, and Monitoring & Review. While 'Greenhouse Gas Emissions' is one of the key themes, it is not the sole focus of the policy. The policy also includes actions to offset Council's greenhouse emissions and increase understanding and awareness of energy consumption and the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. However, these actions are part of a broader set of objectives and actions aimed at achieving environmental sustainability, not specifically climate action."
