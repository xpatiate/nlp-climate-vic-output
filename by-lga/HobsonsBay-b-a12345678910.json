          "answer": "The policy clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy is titled 'Response to Climate Change Action Plan', which indicates that the primary focus is on addressing climate change. The policy outlines the local government's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for a changing climate, which are key aspects of climate action. The policy also includes specific actions that the council will take to achieve its vision, such as delivering a communications and engagement plan that provides information and education to residents, businesses, and schools, and providing advice services and programs that support these groups to take their own climate actions. These actions are designed to be within the control of the council, measurable, impactful, deliverable, and financially responsible, which suggests a serious and strategic approach to climate action.",

It recognizes climate change as a significant challenge that will worsen without collective efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for a changing climate. The document also highlights the importance of both mitigation and adaptation strategies. Mitigation involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions to prevent future increases in global temperatures and other climate impacts. Adaptation involves taking actions to protect human health and wellbeing, physical assets, and the natural environment from the impacts of a changing climate such as rising sea levels and extreme weather events. The document also emphasizes the legal responsibilities of the Council under the Local Government Act 2020 and the Climate Change Act 2017, which require the promotion of environmental sustainability and planning for climate change risks.",

The local government's policy, as outlined in the 'Hobsons Bay Response to Climate Change Action Plan 2030', clearly states that the current state of the climate requires urgent action from all levels of government. The document emphasizes the need for strong and decisive action to protect the community, particularly given the unique challenges faced by Hobsons Bay as a coastal community with several fragile habitats. The policy also highlights the importance of community involvement in addressing climate change, suggesting that everyone has a part to play in this urgent issue. The document's emphasis on urgency is further underscored by the council's declaration of a climate emergency in 2019, which confirms its commitment to taking meaningful action to address climate change.",

The plan outlines a multi-departmental approach to implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the actions, with a Steering Group and Working Group overseeing the progress. This indicates that staff resources are being allocated to manage and execute the plan. Furthermore, the plan mentions the provision of technical support from internal sustainability experts, which again suggests the allocation of staff resources with specific expertise. The plan also includes actions such as developing and delivering training to build capacity across the organisation, which implies the allocation of staff time and expertise.
