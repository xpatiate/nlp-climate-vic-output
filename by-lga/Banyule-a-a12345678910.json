The policy's primary goal is to address climate change and its impacts, particularly in the context of the local area, Banyule. The policy outlines a plan of action for the next decade, with a focus on reducing pressure on the Earth's vital ecosystems and keeping global temperature rise to a maximum of 1.5 degrees. The policy also outlines specific actions to be taken, such as embedding a culture of climate action within the Council, establishing a Climate Action Steering Committee, and fostering collaboration and innovation across the organization.

This indicates a clear technological strategy for reducing emissions. The plan also emphasizes the need for a culture of climate action within the Council, with the implementation of a cultural change program across the Council to embed climate action as an all-staff responsibility. This suggests a strong focus on behaviour change as a key part of the strategy. The plan's actions are designed to shift buildings and vehicles off technology that relies on fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy, reducing energy use and improving the way energy is used.
