          "answer": "The policy under review, the Moorabool Sustainable Environment Strategy 2016-26, clearly identifies climate action as a core purpose or goal. The policy outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change, including understanding and mitigating climate risks to the council and its community, reducing greenhouse emissions, improving water efficiency, and promoting local food supply. The policy also acknowledges the need for flexibility in responding to changes in environmental policy and funding opportunities at all levels of government. The policy's strategic objectives for climate adaptation further underscore the centrality of climate action to the policy's purpose. These objectives include ensuring that the council and community understand the risks of climate change and take actions to prepare for and mitigate these risks."

It identifies climate change as a major driver of change and highlights the increasing frequency and danger of climate impacts such as extreme heat waves, bushfires, and drought. The document emphasizes the need for the Council to plan and mitigate for these climate risks, reduce greenhouse emissions, and assist the community and businesses in cutting their emissions and energy costs. It also underscores the importance of reducing water consumption and improving water efficiency to mitigate future drought and low water supplies. The document further stresses the need for a more localized food supply as part of the climate change response. The Western Alliance for Greenhouse Action's strategies and action plans are also referenced, indicating the Council's alignment with broader climate change initiatives."

However, these are presented as planned actions and strategies rather than urgent calls to action. The documents also mention the goal of achieving a carbon neutral council by 2031, but this is a long-term goal rather than an immediate action.
