          "answer": "The policy under review, the Benalla Rural City Council Environment Strategy 2016-20, does indeed have climate action as a core purpose. The policy outlines a strategic approach to addressing climate change, including both mitigation of emissions and adaptation to impacts. The policy identifies specific actions to be taken, such as implementing a Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan, and it also includes measures for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of these actions. The policy also acknowledges the role of other levels of government and regional bodies in addressing climate change, and it commits the Council to working in partnership with these entities. Therefore, it is clear that climate action is not just a peripheral or incidental aspect of the policy, but rather a central and integral part of its purpose and goals.",

They acknowledge the reality of climate change, attributing it largely to human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. The documents also highlight the complexity of the risks posed by climate change across all areas of community development, economic development, and environmental and natural resource health. The local government's response to these risks is outlined in their Environment Strategy, which includes the implementation of a Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan. This plan is designed to help the council and community adapt to the impacts of climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The documents also note the importance of regular updates to this plan, indicating an understanding of the ongoing and evolving nature of climate change challenges."
