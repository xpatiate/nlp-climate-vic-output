          "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the documents do outline a comprehensive plan for addressing climate change, including setting emissions targets, promoting community involvement, and establishing monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, they do not specifically address the distribution of benefits and opportunities in an equitable manner. The documents mention the need for a coordinated and collective response, community involvement, and the role of the local government in leading the response to climate change. However, these references do not directly relate to the equitable sharing of benefits and opportunities. Therefore, based on the provided documents, the question cannot be answered in the affirmative."
