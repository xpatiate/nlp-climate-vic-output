The policy outlines a strategic approach to addressing climate change, including both mitigation of emissions and adaptation to impacts. The policy includes a Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan, which is to be updated every five years, and integrates actions recommended by the Goulburn Broken Greenhouse Alliance. The policy also outlines specific actions to be taken, such as the replacement of public street-lights with energy efficient lighting, and training for staff on climate change impacts. The policy also includes a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and resource use, and to anticipating and planning for future changes in climate. Therefore, it is clear that climate action is a central goal of this policy."
