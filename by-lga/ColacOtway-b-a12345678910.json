The policy outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change, including mitigation, adaptation, and resilience-building measures. It emphasizes the importance of community engagement, stakeholder collaboration, and advocacy in achieving its climate action goals. The policy also outlines specific actions, such as promoting environmentally sustainable design and partnering with regional and government sectors on climate initiatives. Furthermore, the policy includes a monitoring and evaluation plan to assess the effectiveness of its actions and their environmental outcomes. This comprehensive approach to climate action, coupled with the specific actions and monitoring plan, strongly suggests that climate action is the core purpose of this policy.",

The plan outlines various actions related to climate change, including adaptation, mitigation, and advocacy. It also provides a cost estimate for each action, ranging from low to high.

Instead, it uses broad categories to indicate the cost of each action, such as 'Low ($0–$50,000)', 'Med ($50,000–$150,000)', and 'High (150,000+)'. The plan also indicates whether each action is funded within existing resources or subject to external funding and/or funding by Council as part of an annual budget process.

For instance, the plan mentions the development of environmental sustainability targets, the prioritisation of climate change actions based on the level of Council control, and the consideration of resourcing limitations. Furthermore, the plan includes actions such as staff education and training to understand and implement the carbon emissions hierarchy.

          "answer": "The documents provided do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the policy does mention community engagement, collaboration, and education as part of its climate change action plan, it does not specifically address the equitable distribution of benefits and opportunities. The policy focuses on actions such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting sustainable living, and encouraging community action. It also discusses the development of an Environmental Sustainability Strategy and the prioritisation of climate change actions. However, these actions are not explicitly linked to equity and social justice in the context of sharing the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate."
