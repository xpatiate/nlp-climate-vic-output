The policy outlines a comprehensive plan for addressing climate change, including data gathering and analysis, community engagement, and the development of action plans. It also includes a monitoring framework to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the plan. The policy is designed to address climate change impacts and the effectiveness of adaptation responses, as well as emissions reduction at both the council operations and community level. The policy also emphasizes the importance of community actions and the role of the community in climate action. Therefore, it is clear that the core purpose of this policy is to address climate change through a variety of actions and strategies.",

The Climate Change Action Plan 2020 - 2030 outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change at the local government level. The plan acknowledges the climate emergency and emphasizes the need for immediate action. It outlines specific, time-bound actions for the council, households, businesses, industry, and the agricultural sector. The plan also includes a monitoring framework to ensure effective and efficient delivery of the actions. The rationale for these actions is clearly stated, with the plan noting the very real risks posed by climate change to the council and the land and infrastructure it manages. The plan also highlights the economic benefits of climate action, noting that many actions require small financial investments but are primarily driven using existing resources. Furthermore, the plan emphasizes the role of the community in climate action and encourages community members to take immediate and medium-term actions."

The plan has been developed with an early focus on setting the foundations for improved decision making to respond to climate risk and act on emissions reduction opportunities. Many of these foundation actions require small financial investments, but are primarily driven using existing resources. Additionally, a suite of actions contained within the plan have an initial capital cost which is quickly recouped through operational savings. The plan also mentions that for capital expenditure, borrowing represents a viable option. Furthermore, the plan discusses the integration of climate risk into financial decision making, which implies a financial commitment to climate action.

The plan outlines several actions that are to be led or supported by various departments within the local government. For instance, the 'Sustainable Environment' and 'Economic Development' departments are tasked with leading and supporting the expansion of the 'Climate Governance and Leadership program'. Similarly, the 'Asset Management' department is to lead the refresh of the 'Economic Development Strategy'. The 'Human Resources' department is also involved in embedding climate emergency response into the roles of council staff. These allocations suggest that staff time and expertise, which are crucial non-monetary institutional resources, are being directed towards climate action. However, the plan does not provide specific details on the number of staff allocated or the exact nature of their roles in these actions."

The plan includes technological solutions such as transitioning to all-electric and zero carbon energy, building and retrofitting homes and infrastructure to make them sustainable and climate resilient, and switching to more sustainable transport like walking, cycling, ride sharing and electric vehicles. The plan also encourages behaviour change, such as buying less, recycling and reusing more to achieve zero waste, and supporting sustainable and local businesses.

The adaptation actions are designed to support a resilient local environment, infrastructure, and communities in the face of climate change impacts. The plan recognizes that to build adaptive capacity, individuals, institutions, and communities must simultaneously build five types of capital: human, social, natural, infrastructure, and financial capital. The plan also provides specific actions for different sectors, such as businesses and farming and agriculture. For instance, businesses are encouraged to use the Climate Resilience Toolkit to make their premises more resilient to climate change impacts, while farmers are advised to develop a Farm Climate Adaptation Plan.

          "answer": "The document does discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate, particularly focusing on vulnerable households. It outlines a plan to deliver targeted financial and advisory services to these households, which include the elderly, rentals, and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities. The aim is to help these households respond to climate change impacts, improve social resilience, and reduce energy costs. The document acknowledges that without targeted assistance, these vulnerable groups could miss out on the benefits of climate change action and be more exposed to extreme weather. The policy also emphasizes the importance of fairness and equity, and plans to leverage existing and new programs and funding streams to deliver this assistance. Therefore, the policy does explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate."
