          "answer": "The core purpose of the policy is indeed climate action. The policy is designed to address climate change mitigation, as indicated by its title 'Climate Change Mitigation Strategy to 2050'. The policy outlines a strategic approach to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, aiming to avoid a 1.5°C increase in global average temperature. It includes specific actions such as promoting emission reductions to the community, businesses, and government decision-makers, and evaluating the implementation plan by 2025. The policy also acknowledges the principle of inter-generational equity, recognizing that today's decisions will determine the future climate that children and future generations will experience. Therefore, the policy is fundamentally centered on climate action.",

It aligns its strategy with the Paris Climate Agreement and the Victorian Climate Change Act 2017, indicating a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net zero emissions before 2050. The document also acknowledges the role of cities in addressing climate change and outlines a plan for the City of Melbourne to lead by example. It emphasizes the urgency of action, citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's message that climate change is already impacting communities. The document also presents four scenarios for action, including 'Business as Usual', 'Significant Action', 'Accelerated Action', and 'Purchasing Offsets', demonstrating a comprehensive approach to tackling climate change.",

For instance, the 'Climate Change Mitigation Strategy to 2050' outlines a plan to facilitate and support corporate Power Purchase Agreements through the expansion of the Melbourne Renewable Energy Project within a 1-5 year timeframe. Another action, advocating for energy performance disclosure for a greater range of commercial and residential buildings, is planned to be executed within a 1-3 year timeframe. The documents also mention a plan to evaluate progress in implementing the strategy by 2025. These specific timeframes indicate a clear schedule for the implementation of the climate change mitigation strategy."

The policy also mentions 'Year 1 existing budget allocation, Years 2-5 subject to annual plan and budget processes' in relation to accelerating corporate Power Purchase Agreements.

It acknowledges that climate change will affect everyone who lives, works, and plays in the city, but it also recognizes that some members of the community are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These vulnerable groups include those affected by factors such as low income, age, gender, disability, and background. The document also outlines a socially inclusive approach to addressing climate change, which includes considerations for Aboriginal communities, income inequality, educational background, and disability. This approach aims to identify vulnerabilities and reduce barriers to access programs, thereby addressing the social impacts of climate change.",

Climate change will impact everyone who lives, works and plays in the city. However, some members of our community are more vulnerable to heatwaves, energy prices and reliability, rising food prices and the accessibility and affordability of buildings and transport infrastructure.",

          "answer": "The document does explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate. It outlines a socially inclusive strategy that aims to reflect community priorities and values of fairness and equity. The strategy includes considerations for various social factors such as income inequality, educational background, and disability. For instance, it mentions the impact of energy prices and the upfront cost of installing renewable energy or retrofitting buildings, particularly for renters and those vulnerable to income inequality. The strategy also plans to develop accessible communication materials to cater to different educational backgrounds. Furthermore, it aims to collaborate with community organizations to identify vulnerabilities and reduce barriers to access programs, particularly for people with disabilities. The document also emphasizes the principle of intergenerational equity, recognizing that today's decisions will impact future generations."
