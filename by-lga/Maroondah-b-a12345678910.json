The policy outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change, including both mitigation and adaptation strategies. The policy objectives include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, building resilience in infrastructure and communities, and managing natural resources to promote resilience. The policy also outlines specific actions to be taken, such as planning for climate change risks, seeking partnerships for climate change adaptation, using the natural environment to build adaptive capacity, and encouraging future-proofing design. The policy also emphasizes the importance of community engagement and education in addressing climate change. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is not just a peripheral or secondary concern, but a central goal of the policy.",

It aims to guide the Council's efforts to integrate climate change risk management and adaptation. The documents also mention the importance of community engagement in strategic planning and decision-making related to climate change.

For instance, it mentions the provision of support for residents and businesses to reduce their carbon emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change through programs such as Solar Savers and Councilâ€™s Environmental Upgrade Agreements. These programs likely involve technological solutions such as the installation of solar panels and energy-efficient upgrades.

Vulnerable people in the community are at greater risk of sickness, death and significant financial and social impacts from climate change, including heat, heatwaves and the urban heat island effect. This includes those who already receive community care, the sick and disabled, indigenous, low income, socially isolated, the elderly and very young and CALD communities.",

          "answer": "The documents do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate. While the documents do mention the concept of 'intergenerational equity considerations' and the importance of 'increased capacity, voice, and influence of low-income groups and vulnerable communities', they do not provide specific strategies or actions on how to ensure that the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate are shared equitably. The documents focus more on the risks and impacts of climate change, and the actions that the local government and community are taking to mitigate and adapt to these changes. They also highlight the importance of community engagement and collaboration in addressing climate change. However, they do not delve into the specifics of how the benefits and opportunities that arise from these actions will be distributed equitably among different groups within the community."
