          "answer": "The core purpose of the policy, as outlined in the Stonnington 2021 Climate Emergency Action Plan, is indeed climate action. The policy is designed to address the global climate emergency through immediate and urgent action. It outlines the local government's climate adaptation and mitigation priorities, with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing the city and community for a changing climate. The policy also includes a commitment to review and update the action plan in 2024, taking into account new policies, technology, and stakeholder feedback. This demonstrates a sustained commitment to climate action. Furthermore, the policy acknowledges the council's responsibility to act on climate change and lead local action, contributing to the global effort. This is indicative of the policy's core purpose being climate action."
