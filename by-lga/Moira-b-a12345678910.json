The policy outlines a series of actions and strategies aimed at reducing emissions in various sectors, including the workplace, waste management, and building operations. The policy also includes a commitment to monitor and evaluate progress towards these goals. While the policy does not explicitly state that 'climate action' is its core purpose, the focus on emissions reduction and the implementation of strategies to achieve this goal align with the broader objectives of climate action. Therefore, it can be inferred that climate action is a core purpose of the policy.",

The policy also promotes walking, cycling, and carpooling options to staff and provides incentives for staff to use more sustainable transport options. Furthermore, the policy mentions the Environmental Services department's role in collating, evaluating, and communicating the Council’s annual emissions profile.

Behaviour change is addressed through the development of a low carbon workplace, which includes the use of an internal Green Team to raise awareness and encourage change, facilitating staff education sessions to encourage low carbon behaviours, and promoting the Council’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The plan also considers signing a pledge that demonstrates the Council's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
