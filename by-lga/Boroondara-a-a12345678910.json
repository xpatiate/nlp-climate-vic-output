The policy is designed to set the municipality on a path to meet specific climate action targets. These targets are aimed at mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change. The policy includes a range of actions, some of which are ready to be implemented, while others require further planning and development. The policy also acknowledges that some actions will require commitments from partners or the wider availability of certain technologies. The policy is designed to be flexible, allowing for the implementation of actions when possible. The policy also includes a commitment to monitoring and reporting on progress towards achieving the climate action targets. This includes annual monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions, waste, recycling and FOGO data, tree planting and renewal, water use and harvesting, biodiversity actions, and workshops and community support programs.",

The report also includes community feedback that calls for a sense of urgency, a declaration of a climate emergency, and the need for action to occur.

The community's perception of climate change as an urgent issue is clearly stated, with strong support for the development of a Climate Action Plan. The documents also highlight the community's desire for more than just 'aspirational' targets, indicating a need for concrete, immediate actions. There are calls for the declaration of a climate emergency, which underscores the urgency of the situation. However, it is important to note that while the urgency is recognized, the documents also reveal concerns about the lack of specific timelines, budgets, and detailed plans for achieving the targets. This suggests that while there is a call for urgent action, there is also a demand for well-planned and strategic approaches to addressing climate change.",

For instance, the Climate Action Plan Implementation Plan 2023/24 and 2024/25 outlines several actions with timeframes. Action 1.12, for example, which aligns with the goal of Council being net carbon neutral, is marked as 'Ongoing'. Similarly, action 6.8, which aligns with several actions and supports the target to have 3,000 participants each year in sustainability workshops or education opportunities, is set for 2023/24 and 2024/25. However, it's important to note that while some actions have specific timeframes, others are marked as 'Ongoing', which could be seen as somewhat vague. Furthermore, the documents also indicate that some actions require more planning and development, suggesting that not all actions have a set timeframe yet."

The plan includes actions such as 'Embed climate action into staff roles and responsibilities and performance management' (Action 6.3) and 'Continue to engage an officer to increase community sustainability education and initiatives' (Action 6.8). These actions indicate that the local government is committing staff resources to the implementation of the climate action plan. The allocation of staff roles and responsibilities for climate action suggests that the local government is institutionalising climate action within its operations. This is a positive step as it ensures that climate action is not just a peripheral concern but is integrated into the core functions of the local government.

          "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities in the context of equity and social justice. While the documents do provide a detailed analysis of the local government's Climate Action Plan, including community feedback and proposed actions, they do not specifically address how climate change might disproportionately affect certain vulnerable groups within the community. The documents focus primarily on general community responses, emissions targets, and various sustainability actions. However, they do not delve into the social justice implications of climate change or the specific impacts on vulnerable populations. Therefore, based on the provided documents, the local government's policy does not explicitly address the intersection of climate change, equity, and social justice."

          "answer": "The documents provided do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. The documents primarily focus on the local government's Climate Action Plan, including its implementation, community feedback, and various aspects of environmental sustainability such as energy efficiency, biodiversity, waste management, water use, and sustainable transport. While there are mentions of community education and involvement, specific discussions on equity and social justice in the context of sharing climate benefits and opportunities are not present. Therefore, it cannot be affirmed that the policy includes explicit provisions for equitable sharing of climate benefits and opportunities."
