          "answer": "The policy documents clearly indicate that climate action is a core purpose of the policy. The policy outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change, including both mitigation and adaptation strategies. The policy includes specific actions to reduce emissions, manage water use, reduce urban heat, empower a resilient community, protect biodiversity, and build climate-resilient infrastructure. The policy also emphasizes the importance of integrating climate considerations into policy and strategy development processes. Furthermore, the policy acknowledges the need for a shared response from all levels of government, stakeholders, and the community to effectively manage the impacts of climate change. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is not just a component, but a central goal of the policy.",

The documents highlight the critical state of global warming, citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that warns of the planet warming by an estimated 3-4°C, much higher than the 1.5-2°C pledged as part of the Paris agreement. The documents also emphasize the need for immediate action, stating that there are only 12 years left to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5°C. The documents further underscore the urgency by stating that the next few years are probably the most important in our history. The local government's policy is to help Victoria reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, indicating a commitment to urgent action.

The interaction of age, illness, and income is identified as a strong determinant of vulnerability to climate change within Wyndham. The documents also outline plans to engage with the community to build their capacity to understand the potential range of impacts likely under climate change and to understand how the community is already adapting. This indicates a commitment to social justice by ensuring that vulnerable communities are not left behind in the adaptation process."

          "positive": true,
          "answer": "The documents do discuss the equitable sharing of benefits and opportunities in the context of climate change, although not in those exact terms. The policy outlines plans for community-based projects designed to provide financial savings to residents, particularly those from low socio-economic or vulnerable demographics. This suggests an intention to distribute the benefits of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures in a way that addresses social inequity. The policy also mentions the potential for these savings to stimulate economic growth and employment in the region, indicating an understanding of the broader opportunities that can arise from climate action. However, the documents do not provide specific details on how these benefits and opportunities will be equitably shared, and there is no explicit mention of 'equity and social justice' in the context of a safe climate.",
