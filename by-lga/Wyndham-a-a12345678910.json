          "answer": "The policy documents indicate that climate action is indeed a core purpose of the policy. The policy outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change, including both mitigation and adaptation strategies. The policy's objectives include supporting actions Wyndham is already undertaking in relation to key climate risks, identifying and implementing additional actions required to manage priority climate risks, integrating climate change considerations into council policies and systems, and fostering community understanding and leadership around climate change impacts. The policy also outlines specific actions to be taken, such as integrating climate considerations into policy and strategy development processes, monitoring climate change and adaptation actions' effectiveness, and engaging with the community on climate change. These actions are designed to systematically consider climate change in all relevant new decisions, indicating that climate action is a central goal of the policy.",

The documents highlight the severity of the climate change issue, citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report which states that the planet is on track to warm by an estimated 3-4°C, much higher than the 1.5-2°C pledged as part of the Paris agreement. The documents also mention that there is only a 12-year window for 'global warming' to be kept to a maximum of 1.5°C. The documents further emphasize the need for urgent action by stating that the next few years are probably the most important in our history. The local government's policy is to help Victoria reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, indicating a commitment to urgent action.

The strategy also includes a number of specific actions, such as managing water use and urban heat reduction, empowering a resilient community, protecting biodiversity, building climate resilient infrastructure, and establishing adaptation excellence. However, these actions are presented as part of a balanced approach to climate change adaptation, rather than as a higher priority than other policies.

The documents outline a number of actions and priorities related to climate change, including integrating climate considerations into policy and strategy development processes, monitoring climate change and adaptation actions' effectiveness, and developing a baseline to monitor climate impacts on council buildings and road maintenance.

The policy mentions 'Existing Recurrent' as a source of funding for several actions related to climate change adaptation. For instance, the policy outlines that staff time, a critical resource in policy implementation, is included in the costs and is funded through 'Existing Recurrent' funding. This suggests that there is an ongoing, recurrent budget allocation for these climate actions. However, the policy does not provide specific figures or a detailed breakdown of the funding allocation.

The policy outlines various actions related to climate change, and for each of these actions, it mentions that staff time will be included in the costs. This indicates that the local government is allocating non-monetary institutional resources, specifically staff time, to implement these actions. For instance, the policy mentions the development of strategies and policies, the development of budget bids, and the monitoring of climate change impacts on road maintenance and council buildings as areas where staff time will be allocated. This allocation of staff time is a clear indication of the local government's commitment to addressing climate change and integrating climate considerations into its policy and strategy development processes."

          "answer": "The documents explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. They highlight that climate risks relating to the vulnerable are ranked highly due to the potentially deadly impacts of heatwaves on the elderly and sick. The documents also identify that people more likely to be vulnerable to climate change include those that live alone, have difficult socio-economic circumstances, come from racial or ethnic groups, or those in aged care facilities. Within Wyndham, it is thought that the interaction of age, illness, and income will be a strong determinant of vulnerability to climate change. The documents also mention that the local government plans to engage with the community to understand their capacity to adapt and tailor responses accordingly. This includes building the capacity of the community to understand the potential range of impacts likely under climate change and building an understanding of how the community is already adapting."

          "positive": true,
          "answer": "The documents do discuss the equitable sharing of benefits and opportunities related to a safe climate, particularly in relation to vulnerable demographics. The policy outlines that community-based projects will be designed to provide financial savings to residents, particularly those from low socio-economic or vulnerable demographics. This suggests an intention to distribute the benefits of climate action equitably among the community. The policy also mentions the potential for these savings to stimulate economic growth and employment in the region, which could provide further opportunities for disadvantaged groups. However, the documents do not provide specific details on how these benefits and opportunities will be equitably shared, and there is no explicit discussion of 'equity and social justice' in the context provided.",
