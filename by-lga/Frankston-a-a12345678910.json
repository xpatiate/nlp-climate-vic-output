The policy is designed to provide a forward plan with prioritized actions for the Council to decrease its greenhouse gas emissions and set the foundation to become carbon neutral by 2025. The policy includes actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the Council’s assets, operations, and services, as well as actions to support the local community transition to a low emissions future. The policy also acknowledges the global problem of climate change and the Council's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, saving energy, and transitioning to low carbon fuel sources. The policy's focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy, and carbon neutrality clearly indicates that climate action is the core purpose of the policy.",

The policy outlines several actions related to climate change, each with a designated responsible department and, in some cases, internal and external partners. For instance, the policy encourages staff and the community to take the Victorian Government’s climate change pledge (Action C18). The Sustainable Assets and Community Relations departments are responsible for this action. Another action (C19) involves staying abreast of the latest research and innovations in Smart City technologies for Council assets and city and infrastructure planning, particularly as they relate to energy and emissions reduction. This action involves multiple departments, including Sustainable Assets, Building and Facilities, Engineering Services, and Capital Works Delivery. These examples demonstrate that the policy not only allocates staff to climate action but also encourages interdepartmental collaboration on these issues."
