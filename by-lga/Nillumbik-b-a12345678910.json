It also includes a commitment to track progress against targets and indicators, and to assess outcomes achieved. The policy emphasizes both mitigation and adaptation in Council's activities and operations, as well as in the broader community. It sets a goal of net zero emissions in Council operations by 2030 and a 2035 net zero emissions target for the community. The policy also identifies eight focus areas for proactive climate action.",

While the policy does mention the need for collaboration and advocacy for climate action at all levels of government, it does not specify any particular organizations or partnerships. The policy also mentions leveraging relationships with agencies, organizations, and groups to stay informed about best practices in climate action, but again, no specific entities are named. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be confirmed that the policy refers to specific regional associations, alliances, or other partnerships related to climate."

While the documents do mention the impacts of climate change on various aspects of life, including health, wellbeing, and economic resilience, they do not specifically address how these impacts might disproportionately affect vulnerable communities. The documents also outline plans for mitigation and adaptation, but these are not explicitly linked to equity or social justice concerns. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that the policy discusses the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities in terms of equity and social justice."

While the documents do outline various strategies and actions for climate resilience, adaptation, and safety, they do not specifically address the distribution of these benefits and opportunities in an equitable manner. The focus of the documents is primarily on community engagement, climate action leadership, and the implementation of climate-responsive services and infrastructure. However, the aspect of equity and social justice in the distribution of these benefits and opportunities is not explicitly addressed."
