The policy outlines a comprehensive plan to tackle climate change, with a focus on integrating climate action into all aspects of the local government's operations. The policy sets out 70 actions to be undertaken over the life of the strategy to achieve the identified goals and objectives. These actions are broad and encompass a wide range of specific actions, programs, and projects that the Council will undertake over four years. The policy also includes a Monitoring and Evaluation section, which contains key questions, indicators, and targets for each goal. The policy is updated annually to reflect changing needs and opportunities and respond to monitoring and evaluation findings. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is the core purpose of the policy.",

The strategy includes a clear goal of achieving net zero corporate emissions by 2025 and net zero community emissions by 2030. The plan also mentions the installation of solar panels as a technological solution to generate clean renewable energy on-site. Furthermore, the strategy emphasizes the importance of community mobilization and education on climate change, which can be seen as a form of promoting behaviour change. The plan also includes actions to incorporate climate change messages into public health, transport, and youth education, and to update the Council's website to ensure climate change messaging appears throughout.

The council's Climate Emergency Response Strategy 2021-2025 outlines a number of measures aimed at supporting vulnerable populations in the face of climate change. These include understanding the needs and barriers to action of population segments particularly exposed to climate change risks, investing in services and partnerships to support the most vulnerable community members, and engaging and educating residents and business owners about how they can best adapt to and protect themselves and their community against climate impacts. The council also plans to provide an annual progress report on key programs and outcomes, including the number of vulnerable people supported. This demonstrates a clear recognition of the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable communities and a commitment to addressing this issue."
