The Hume City Council's Climate Action Plan is a key component of Humeâ€™s leadership response to climate change and aims to enhance and expand action in response to the urgency and magnitude of the current climate situation. The policy outlines a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to climate impacts, and lobbying for further climate action. It also emphasizes the importance of integrating climate action across the whole organization and in work with partners and the community. The policy also includes specific actions and activities, such as developing communication campaigns for residents to take well-informed climate action and integrating climate considerations into all decisions, strategies, and plans."

While the documents clearly indicate that the local government is taking climate change seriously, with various actions and initiatives outlined, there is no explicit statement prioritising climate change response over other policies. The documents highlight the importance of climate change action, with references to a 'Climate Emergency Plan', 'Climate Action Plan', and the need for 'fast action'. However, these references do not necessarily imply that these actions are prioritised above all other policies. It is also important to note that the documents emphasise the need for a holistic approach, involving all levels of government, industry, business, not-for-profits, organisations, and citizens.
