The policy is titled 'Zero Net Carbon Action Plan – 2020-2025', which suggests a focus on reducing carbon emissions to net zero, a key aspect of climate action. The policy outlines a number of actions aimed at mitigating the impacts of climate change, such as updating the Environmental Sustainable Development policy to address GHG emission reductions, developing a climate adaptation strategy, and investing in energy efficiency and solar projects. The policy also includes measures to educate staff and the community about climate change and how to achieve carbon neutrality. Furthermore, the policy aims to align adaptation approaches with a zero net emission approach, including the development of an urban forest to reduce heat island effects. Therefore, it is clear that the core purpose of the policy is climate action."
