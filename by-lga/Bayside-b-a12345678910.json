The policy is designed to address the climate emergency by identifying actions the Council will take to reduce environmental impact. This includes both mitigation strategies to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. The policy also emphasizes the Council's role as a leader and advocate for change across other tiers of government, and its role to encourage and facilitate community participation and collaboration. The policy also outlines a commitment to making the climate emergency one of the highest priorities, leveraging resources to respond to the climate emergency, and making decisions based on the best available evidence to address the economic, social, and environmental impacts of climate change.",

Another action, 'Include consideration of the response to the ‘Climate Emergency’ in all reports to Council', is marked as 'Ongoing'. The action to 'Include requirements to address environmental impact into leases of Council property' is set for completion by June 2024.

The plan outlines a series of actions, each with a designated budget source, which is primarily the existing operational budget. The plan also provides a cost estimate for each action, categorised as low, medium, or high. For instance, the plan includes actions such as establishing a coordinated program of community awareness and education, supporting vulnerable community members in the transition to 'zero carbon' energy, and exploring innovative funding models to support investment in climate action. Furthermore, the document mentions that an additional $172,880 has been allocated to purchase carbon offsets and achieve carbon neutrality from 2020.

Furthermore, the plan includes actions that require the involvement of various departments within the local government, such as Environmental Sustainability, Community Services, and Procurement. These actions range from supporting vulnerable community members in the switch to 'zero carbon' energy (Action 7.6) to reviewing and updating the Procurement Policy and procedures to address climate change impacts (Action 1.5).

          "answer": "The policy document does explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate. It outlines a commitment to ensuring that all parts of the community can participate in climate action and that vulnerability and equity are addressed in the transition. The policy also includes specific actions to support vulnerable community members in the switch to 'zero carbon' energy. This includes offering subsidised home energy assessments and supporting access to affordable energy efficiency upgrades. These actions demonstrate a clear intention to ensure that the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate are shared equitably across the community, particularly with those who are most vulnerable.",
