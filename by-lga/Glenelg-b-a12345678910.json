          "answer": "The policy documents do not explicitly state that climate action is the core purpose or goal of the policy. While the policy does address climate change and its impacts, it does not clearly establish climate action as its primary objective. The policy includes actions related to climate change, such as keeping the public informed about climate change impacts, incorporating climate change considerations into the Glenelg Shire planning scheme, and facilitating community-based discussions on the environmental impact of climate change. However, these actions appear to be part of a broader environmental strategy, rather than a dedicated climate action policy. The policy also addresses other environmental issues, such as solid waste management, and includes actions that are not directly related to climate change, such as developing action plans and decision-making tools. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that climate action is the core purpose or goal of the policy."

However, these actions are presented as ongoing or long-term strategies, with priority implementation timelines ranging from high (in the next three years) to low (more than five years). The documents also mention the need for strong submissions for Natural Resource Management (NRM) funds to assist resourcing, suggesting that the implementation of these actions is contingent on funding availability. Therefore, while the documents clearly acknowledge the importance of addressing climate change, they do not convey a sense of urgency or immediacy in their proposed actions."

Similarly, the policy outlines that the Glenelg planning scheme will be regularly reviewed to reflect the most up-to-date climate change information 'within existing budgets'.

The policy outlines various strategies and actions related to climate change, and for each of these, it identifies the responsible staff or department within the local government. For instance, the Glenelg Shire Council (GSC) and its Environmental Sustainability Committee (ESC) are frequently mentioned as the lead entities responsible for implementing various climate-related actions. The policy also mentions the need for 'relevant staff' in several instances, indicating that specific personnel will be tasked with these actions. Furthermore, the policy outlines the need for community engagement and education on climate change, which would require the allocation of staff resources for effective implementation. However, it should be noted that while the policy does allocate institutional resources, it often mentions that these actions will be carried out 'within existing budgets', suggesting that there may be limitations on the resources available for these actions."
