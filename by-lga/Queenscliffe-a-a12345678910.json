          "answer": "The policy under review, the 'Climate Emergency Response Plan 2021-2031', clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy is designed to address the climate emergency, as declared by the local government, and outlines a comprehensive plan to mitigate the effects of climate change and adapt to its consequences. The policy is structured around three key criteria: Mitigation, Adaptation, and Influence. Mitigation refers to actions that reduce emissions, Adaptation involves changes in natural or human systems to prepare for climate change, and Influence refers to actions that contribute towards Mitigation and Adaptation. The policy also emphasizes the importance of community engagement and education in addressing the climate emergency. Therefore, it is evident that the core purpose of this policy is to take action against climate change.",

The plan mentions that most of the action items will be subject to full or substantial grant funding. It also states that an Implementation Plan will be developed to detail resourcing implications, funding opportunities, project delivery plans, activity priorities, and governance. This indicates a clear intention to allocate resources, including funding, towards climate action. However, the exact amounts, sources, and allocation of this funding are not specified in the provided documents.
