          "answer": "The policy, as outlined in the MV2040 Action Plan, clearly identifies climate action as a core purpose. The policy is designed to address climate change through a variety of strategies, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diverting waste from landfill, protecting and recycling water supplies, enhancing the urban environment and ecology, and keeping the city green and cool. The policy also includes specific actions to address climate change, such as undertaking mapping and analysis of urban heat island effects, encouraging community members to improve tree canopy cover, and developing an internal Council program to respond to climate emergencies. The policy also sets targets for reducing emissions from Council operations and achieving zero net emissions for the community by 2040. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is a central goal of the policy.",

It outlines a series of actions and strategies to be implemented within specific timeframes, indicating a sense of urgency. The document mentions the declaration of a climate emergency by the Council in October 2019, which is designed to 'accelerate sustained and meaningful action by all levels of government'. This declaration is a clear call for rapid action. The document also sets specific targets for reducing carbon emissions, with interim community emissions reduction targets set for 2025 and 2030.

Similarly, the action to 'Develop an internal Council program to respond to climate emergency' is also set for 2020-2021. Other actions such as 'Assess Council’s climate change adaptation performance using relevant external and industry monitoring, evaluation and reporting frameworks and tools' and 'Advocate to the State Government for a state-wide policy that encourages more green roofs on high density developments' are also planned for 2020-2021.

While the documents do emphasize the importance of addressing climate change and outline various strategies and actions to mitigate its effects, they do not explicitly rank these actions in terms of priority over other policies. The documents mention the declaration of a climate emergency and the development of an action plan to respond to it. However, they also note that the delivery of this action plan is subject to feasibility, including cost-effectiveness, Council budget and priorities, access to external funding, and other constraints to delivery of action items. This suggests that while climate change is a significant concern, its mitigation is one of many priorities for the local government."

While the documents do outline a number of actions and strategies related to climate change, such as prioritising electric over gas infrastructure, installing solar energy systems, and developing programs to assist residents in purchasing solar systems, these are specific initiatives rather than a blanket requirement for all council activities. The documents also mention the development of an internal council program to respond to the climate emergency and the assessment of the council's climate change adaptation performance. However, these again are specific actions rather than a general policy requirement for all council activities.

It also aims to ensure new private and public buildings meet high sustainability standards and to upgrade existing buildings. In terms of behaviour change, the plan includes actions to encourage community members to improve tree canopy cover and to educate them about the urban heat island effect.
