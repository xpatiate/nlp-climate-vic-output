The policy outlines a series of measures aimed at addressing climate change, including monitoring and reporting on the council's energy use, advocating for government leadership in setting greenhouse gas reduction targets, and participating in joint procurement of renewable power. The policy also outlines responses to the impacts of climate change, such as hotter and drier weather, increased demand for water, and more extreme weather events. These responses include measures to protect and enhance biodiversity, upgrade and maintain critical water points, and implement a heatwave plan. The policy also includes a commitment to review and enhance the council's climate change commitment and policy, and to review its procurement policy to encourage sustainable procurement. Therefore, it is clear that the core purpose of the policy is to take action on climate change."

These changes are impacting the local community and environment, affecting agriculture, natural biodiversity, and community infrastructure. The documents also highlight the community's expectation of the council's social responsibility to minimize environmental footprint. The council's response includes measures to mitigate flood events, invest in resilient infrastructure, monitor and reduce energy consumption, and advocate for government leadership in setting targets for greenhouse gas reduction. The Heatwave Plan also acknowledges the increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves due to climate change, and the need for preparedness to protect vulnerable community members."
