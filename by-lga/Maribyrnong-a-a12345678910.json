          "answer": "The policy clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The Maribyrnong City Council Climate Emergency Action Plan is designed to address the climate emergency through strategic direction, vision, and high-level goals. The policy outlines key measures to track and evaluate actions over the next four years, with the aim of measuring outcomes against the high-level goals in the Climate Emergency Strategy. The policy also commits to ceasing emissions of greenhouse gases by the Council and working with the Maribyrnong community to transition to zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The policy further emphasizes the need for local governments to manage their own greenhouse emissions, support and work with local communities, and undertake advocacy to address the climate emergency."

The document acknowledges the global climate emergency as an unprecedented threat to society, economy, and environment. It recognizes that the local community is already experiencing the impacts of climate change through extreme weather events, heat waves, flooding, health impacts, bushfire smoke, and other impacts to air and water quality. The document also highlights the benefits of taking climate action, such as increased vegetation and greening, decreased truck and vehicle pollution, more connected and safe cycling and walking options, and more comfortable housing. The Council's commitment to addressing the climate emergency is reflected in its key objectives, which include ceasing emissions of greenhouse gases by Council and working with the community to transition to zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, drawing down existing and future greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere, and empowering and mobilising community action and building community resilience.",

This statement clearly indicates a sense of urgency in the council's approach to climate change. The plan also includes specific actions and timelines, further emphasizing the urgency of the situation. For instance, the council plans to progressively update and review all relevant policies and plans to include climate emergency mitigation, adaptation, and resilience.
