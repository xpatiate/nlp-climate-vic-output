This is a clear commitment to climate action, as reducing emissions is a key strategy in mitigating the impacts of climate change. The policy outlines specific action areas, including Net Zero Business, Net Zero Homes, Net Zero New Developments, Net Zero Transport, and Net Zero Waste. These areas indicate a comprehensive approach to climate action, encompassing various sectors of the community and economy. The policy also acknowledges the need for collaboration and engagement with various stakeholders, including other levels of government, businesses, and the community, further emphasizing its commitment to climate action.",

For instance, the plan proposes to apply innovative solutions to use waste products in operations, such as recycled content in building materials. It also plans to review infrastructure design guidelines to require all building materials for roads, paths, kerb and channel, and concrete to use high recycled content and/or low emissions materials. Behavioural changes are encouraged through community engagement and awareness-raising initiatives.
