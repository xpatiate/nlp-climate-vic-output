The policy is a comprehensive plan that outlines the council's strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change over a ten-year period. The policy's objectives include demonstrating the council's commitment to taking action on climate change, driving the council's response to addressing the climate emergency through mitigation actions, and supporting communities across the Shire to adapt to current and future climate impacts. The policy also outlines specific actions that the council will take, such as embedding climate change considerations into council processes, increasing council staff knowledge about the climate emergency, and reducing emissions generated by council operations. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is the core purpose of this policy.",

It acknowledges that climate change risks will have a greater impact on those who are already vulnerable, such as older people, people with disabilities, or those in unsecure housing. The local government, in this case, the Golden Plains Shire Council, plays a key role in educating and sharing information with residents, schools, and businesses. The Council is committed to using its leadership and resources to partner with the community, other Councils, Traditional Owner groups, and the Barwon South West Climate Alliance to amplify community voices and undertake collective advocacy and action. This indicates a recognition of the need for equity and social justice in addressing the impacts of climate change.",

          "positive": false,
          "answer": "The documents provided do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the policy does mention that climate risks will have a greater impact on vulnerable groups such as older people, people with disabilities, or those in unsecure housing, it does not provide specific strategies or actions on how the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate will be equitably shared among different groups. The policy focuses more on general climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies such as educating the community, promoting sustainable practices, and embedding climate action in council actions. Therefore, without explicit mention or detailed strategies on equitable sharing of climate benefits and opportunities, the question cannot be answered in the affirmative."
