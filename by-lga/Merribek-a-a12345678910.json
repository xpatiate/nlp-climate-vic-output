The policy is titled 'Zero Carbon Climate Emergency Action Plan' and it outlines a comprehensive plan for the local government to address climate change. The policy aims to eliminate and draw down greenhouse gas emissions, recognising the need for a nationwide and global emergency response. It also acknowledges the importance of engaging and mobilising civil society and businesses in campaigning for emergency-mode action on climate change. The policy sets specific goals, such as achieving a 75 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 and transitioning to a zero carbon society. It also outlines specific actions and programs to achieve these goals, such as community mobilisation, advocacy campaigns, and behaviour change initiatives.",

Additionally, the plan outlines the allocation of an estimated $104k per annum from 2020/21 for a Climate Emergency Integration Officer. The plan also mentions a potential allocation of up to $200k per annum via a 5-year Funding Agreement to the Australian Energy Foundation for activities supportive of Zero Carbon Moreland 2040 goals.
