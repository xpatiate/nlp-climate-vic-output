The policy was developed in response to the local government's declaration of a climate emergency and is aimed at integrating strong mitigation, adaptation, and advocacy measures across all services. The policy sets six strategic priorities to focus the climate emergency response, with more detailed actions to be developed and costed under each strategic priority. The policy also emphasizes the importance of considering climate change in all aspects of the local government's operations and decision-making processes. This is further evidenced by the policy's commitment to changing the council's culture to value, prioritize, and champion the application of a climate change lens to all council decisions, operations, and functions."

The Climate Emergency Strategic Action Plan, adopted in September 2020, outlines the local government's commitment to addressing the climate emergency through mitigation, adaptation, and advocacy measures across all its services. The plan sets six strategic priorities to focus the climate emergency response, with more detailed actions to be developed under each strategic priority. The Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan also emphasizes the need for adaptation to climate change, stating that despite efforts to mitigate climate change, some form of adaptation is inevitable. The plan aims to increase the resilience of Council’s infrastructure and service delivery by building internal capacity to absorb, adapt, and adjust to the expected shocks of climate change. These documents demonstrate a clear understanding of the need for action on climate change and a commitment to implementing strategies to address this issue."

For instance, it mentions actions that are to be taken 'immediately', within '1 year', within '2-3 years', and within '3+ years'. The document also mentions that the new Council has 12 months to deliver the Council Plan, and that the review of plans and policies could start before this. The document also mentions that culture change is a long-term undertaking, indicating a timeframe that extends beyond the immediate future.
