The policy outlines the local government's commitment to addressing climate change through a variety of strategies and actions. These include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting renewable energy, improving environmental performance standards, and advocating for state and national initiatives to support energy efficiency. The policy also emphasizes the role of the local government in influencing stakeholders and supporting the community in reducing emissions. Furthermore, the policy acknowledges the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation to assess the effectiveness of its climate action strategies. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is not just a component of the policy, but its central goal.",

For example, the plan recommends that Council continue existing activities to promote climate change action, and it states that this will be done using current resources. Similarly, the plan proposes the integration of climate change into decision making across Council, particularly in regards to management of assets and delivery of services, and again it states that this will be done using current resources.

It mentions the Central Victorian Greenhouse Alliance, a regional initiative for climate change action, as a key partner in the development and implementation of relevant projects. The document also refers to the North Central CMA, with which the local government plans to work on programs addressing climate change on landscapes and biodiversity values. Furthermore, the document mentions the Municipal Association of Victoria (MAV) and the Central Alliance for Greenhouse Action (CVGA) as potential avenues for advocacy on climate change matters. These partnerships and alliances are crucial for the local government's climate change action plan as they provide opportunities for collaboration, resource sharing, and collective advocacy.",

          "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities in the context of equity and social justice. While the documents do outline various strategies and actions for mitigating and adapting to climate change, they do not specifically address how these measures will affect or benefit vulnerable communities. The documents focus primarily on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting renewable energy, and integrating climate change considerations into decision-making processes. They also mention community engagement and support for climate action, but do not explicitly link these efforts to equity or social justice concerns. Therefore, based on the provided context, the documents do not meet the high standard of evidence required to affirmatively answer the question."

          "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the documents do outline various strategies and initiatives related to climate change action, such as reducing support for the fossil fuel industry, integrating climate change into decision making, and promoting climate change action in the community, they do not specifically address the equitable distribution of benefits and opportunities arising from these actions. The documents also mention the development of community support initiatives and the promotion of sustainable practices, but these are not explicitly linked to equity and social justice. Therefore, based on the provided context, the question cannot be answered in the affirmative."
