The policy is designed to address the impacts of climate change and to mitigate the contribution of the council's operations to greenhouse gas emissions. The policy sets a target of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions from council operations by July 2023. It also outlines a pathway of initiatives to achieve this target, including the development of a Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan. The policy also commits to annual monitoring and reporting of emissions, and a review of the target, pathway, and investment strategy in 2024. The policy's focus on climate action is further underscored by its commitment to support the community in reducing their emissions and to improve community knowledge through initiatives and education activities.",
