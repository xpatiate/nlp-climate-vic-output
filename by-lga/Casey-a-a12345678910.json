          "answer": "The policy under review, the City of Casey's Emissions Management Plan 2018-2022, clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption from Council's operations, aligning with national and state climate change commitments. The policy outlines a strategic pathway for the City of Casey to invest in energy efficiency and renewable technology to maximise economic and environmental benefits. It sets ambitious targets for emissions reduction and renewable energy generation, and outlines a range of initiatives to achieve these targets, including retrofitting and upgrading buildings, investing in renewable energy technology, and improving fleet vehicle fuel efficiency. The policy also commits to regular reporting on progress against targets and to communicating achievements to stakeholders and the wider community. Therefore, it is clear that the policy's core purpose is to take action on climate change and transition to a low carbon economy.",
