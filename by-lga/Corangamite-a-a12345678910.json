While the policy does address aspects related to climate change, such as developing locally specific adaptation responses to climate variability and identifying climate variability impacts and opportunities, it does not clearly establish climate action as its primary objective. The policy also covers other environmental and sustainability issues, such as waste, energy, water, and environmentally sustainable design. Furthermore, the policy outlines a process for developing annual action plans to achieve the goals set out in the strategy, but it does not specify that these goals are primarily focused on climate action. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be definitively stated that climate action is the core purpose or goal of the policy."

Additionally, the policy also aims to increase the use of sustainable transport options by staff, such as biking, walking, and car-pooling, by 5% by 2019. This suggests a focus on behaviour change as a means of reducing emissions.
