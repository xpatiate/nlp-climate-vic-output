It aims to prioritize strategic directions, promote actions for implementation, and identify risks related to carbon pollution and climate change. The policy also seeks to fit into existing strategies, policies, and action plans. The policy's purpose is not only to respond to climate change but also to proactively plan for it. It aims to reduce corporate greenhouse gas emissions, increase the use of renewable fuels, and build resilience to climate change impacts in Council’s operations, services, and infrastructure. The policy also seeks to educate and build community capacity, demonstrating that climate action is indeed the core purpose of the policy.",

          "answer": "The documents indeed refer to specific regional associations, alliances, and other partnerships related to climate. The local government has outlined a strategy to partner across the region and government sector to deliver on climate change initiatives. This is done through a collaborative approach with specific entities such as the Eastern Alliance for Greenhouse Action (EAGA), Cities Power Partnership, and Sustainability Victoria’s TAKE2 program. These partnerships are aimed at identifying and addressing climate risks and opportunities in the Council Plan and by each business unit through their annual Business Planning process. The government also plans to advocate to State and Federal government for action on climate change that benefits the local community. This shows a clear commitment to collaboration and partnership in addressing climate change.",

          "answer": "The documents provided do not explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities in the context of equity and social justice. While the documents do outline various strategies and actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change, they do not specifically address how these measures will affect or benefit vulnerable communities. The documents mention community resilience, community support, and ensuring no one is left behind in the transition to a low carbon future. However, these references are not specific to vulnerable communities and do not explicitly address equity and social justice issues. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that the local government policy explicitly discusses the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities in terms of equity and social justice."

          "answer": "The documents provided do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the documents do outline various strategies, actions, and plans related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, they do not specifically address the distribution of benefits and opportunities in an equitable manner. The documents focus on reducing emissions, planning for climate change risks, partnering for climate change initiatives, and monitoring performance. However, they do not delve into the specifics of how these actions will ensure equity and social justice in the distribution of climate benefits and opportunities. Therefore, based on the provided documents, the question cannot be answered in the affirmative."
