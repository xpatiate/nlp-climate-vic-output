The policy outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change, including mitigation, adaptation, and systemic actions. It includes specific actions such as developing and implementing a climate response communication and training program, advocating for a stronger climate response, and integrating climate change information across all areas of Council’s operations. The policy also outlines a plan for tracking progress and sharing success stories, indicating a commitment to transparency and accountability in its climate action efforts. The policy's focus on climate action is further emphasized by its commitment to update relevant plans, strategies, and policies to ensure they deliver on environmental sustainability and climate response. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is the core purpose of this policy."

The local government's policy outlines a strategy to establish and maintain partnerships and memberships that support the fast-following of new emissions reduction, climate risk mitigation, and sustainability technology and initiatives. This strategy is systemic and ongoing, with the City Services (Environmental Sustainability) and Sustainability Officer leading the effort. The policy also mentions the need for collaboration with external partners such as ALGA (Australian Local Government Association), MAV (Municipal Association of Victoria), EAGA (Eastern Alliance for Greenhouse Action), SV (Sustainability Victoria), RV (Regional Victoria), VGA (Victorian Government Architect), and ERG (Energy Rating Guide). These partnerships and collaborations are crucial for the local government to effectively respond to climate change, reduce emissions, and increase community resilience.",

          "answer": "The documents do explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. The policy outlines plans to identify communities that are vulnerable to climate change impacts and to support them in increasing their resilience. It also mentions leveraging existing and new community partnerships to connect low-income, hard-to-reach, and vulnerable households to sustainability programs and services, such as energy efficiency retrofitting schemes. This indicates a recognition of the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable communities and a commitment to addressing these disparities. The policy also acknowledges the potential for increased heat-related deaths, particularly among the elderly and other vulnerable members of the community, further highlighting the focus on vulnerable populations.",

          "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the documents do outline various strategies and actions related to climate change adaptation and resilience, they do not specifically address the distribution of benefits and opportunities. The documents focus more on the practical aspects of climate response, such as leveraging community programs, updating municipal plans, and embedding climate change considerations into various aspects of local government operations. They do not delve into the social justice implications of these actions or how they might contribute to a more equitable distribution of climate benefits and opportunities."
