          "answer": "The policy under review, the Strathbogie 2022 Climate Change Action Plan, clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy is structured around five main areas of action, all of which are directly related to climate change: protecting the natural environment, reducing emissions, building a climate-resilient community, moving sustainably, and advocating for change. The policy outlines specific actions within these areas, such as advocating for local net zero emissions community energy solutions, establishing a Climate Action Steering Committee, and setting a goal of net zero emissions by 2025 for Council operations. The policy also emphasizes the importance of partnerships with residents, businesses, farmers, and community groups in driving climate action. Therefore, it is evident that the core purpose of this policy is to address climate change through a variety of strategies and actions.",

The plan outlines several actions that involve the mobilisation of staff resources. For instance, it mentions the inclusion of information on the Council's climate change response in staff recruitment and induction processes, indicating an institutional commitment to climate action. The plan also proposes the establishment of a Climate Action Steering Committee or Green Team to guide the implementation of new climate action projects. This suggests the allocation of staff time and expertise to the cause. Furthermore, the plan advocates for the integration of ESD principles in the Local Government Infrastructure, which would likely involve the use of staff resources. Therefore, the plan does allocate non-monetary institutional resources, specifically staff resources, to climate action."

While the documents do outline a number of actions and strategies related to climate change, such as promoting environmental sustainability, advocating for change, and developing a climate change action plan, they do not specifically address the effects of climate change on vulnerable populations. The documents focus more on general environmental sustainability, climate change mitigation, and adaptation strategies. Therefore, without explicit mention or discussion of the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities, the question cannot be answered in the affirmative."

While the documents do outline various actions and strategies related to climate change, such as promoting environmental sustainability, advocating for change, and incorporating climate change response into staff recruitment and induction processes, they do not specifically address the equitable distribution of benefits and opportunities. The documents also mention collaboration with the Taungurang Land and Waters Council and the establishment of a Climate Action Steering Committee, but these actions are not directly linked to the concept of 'equity and social justice' in the context of climate change benefits and opportunities."
