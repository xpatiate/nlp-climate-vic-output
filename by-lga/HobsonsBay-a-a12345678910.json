          "answer": "The policy clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy is titled 'Hobsons Bay Response to Climate Change Action Plan', which indicates that the primary focus is on addressing climate change. The policy outlines the council's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for a changing climate, which are key aspects of climate action. The policy also details specific actions that the council will take to achieve its vision, including measures that are within the council's control, measurable, impactful, deliverable, and financially responsible. These actions are designed to support the council's vision and commitments to reduce emissions and make necessary changes to protect health, wellbeing, and assets in a changing climate. The policy also acknowledges the council's legal responsibilities to promote environmental sustainability and plan for climate change risks.",

It states that climate change is a significant challenge that will worsen unless collective action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for a changing climate. The document also highlights the importance of mitigation and adaptation strategies. Mitigation involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions to prevent future increases in global temperatures and other climate impacts. Adaptation involves taking actions to protect human health and wellbeing, physical assets, and the natural environment from the impacts of a changing climate such as rising sea levels and extreme weather events. The document also emphasizes the need for the local government to comply with legislation, meet commitments in the Council Plan, and support the delivery of Council’s suite of environment and climate-related policies.",

The Hobsons Bay City Council recognizes climate change as a 'current and significant challenge' that will worsen without collective action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for a changing climate. The Council's declaration of a climate emergency in 2019 further underscores its commitment to taking meaningful action to address climate change. The document also emphasizes that the effects of climate change are already being felt, with rising sea levels and an increase in flooding and other extreme weather events threatening the community.

While the documents clearly outline the local government's commitment to addressing climate change, including the declaration of a climate emergency in 2019, they do not specify that this commitment should supersede other policy areas. The documents detail a range of actions and strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change, including community engagement, emissions reduction, and risk management. However, these are presented as part of a comprehensive approach to local governance, rather than as a priority above all other policy areas.

The plan outlines a series of actions to be taken in response to climate change, each of which is accompanied by a timeframe and a funding status. The funding status indicates whether the budget for the action has been confirmed or is subject to future funding considerations. For instance, the plan includes actions such as delivering a cohesive communications and engagement plan, providing advice services and programs, and seeking partnership and funding opportunities, all of which have an 'Established Operational Budget'. Other actions, such as conducting climate vulnerability assessments, are marked as 'Scalable - Extent and timing subject to annual Budget Allocation'.

The plan outlines a multi-departmental approach to implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the actions, with a Steering Group and Working Group overseeing the progress. This indicates that staff resources are being allocated to the climate action plan. Furthermore, the plan mentions the provision of technical support from internal sustainability experts, which again suggests the allocation of staff resources. The plan also includes actions such as developing and delivering training to build capacity across the organisation, which implies the allocation of staff time and expertise.
