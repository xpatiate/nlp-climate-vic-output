While the policy does address climate change, it does so as part of a broader environmental sustainability strategy. The policy's stated purpose is to guide the local government's decision-making and management practices to achieve environmentally responsible and sustainable outcomes for the municipality. It also aims to address the potential adverse impacts of climate change and promote the adoption of environmentally sustainable practices within the municipality.

The Victorian Climate Change Green Paper, released in 2009, is the government's response to climate change, aiming to stimulate discussion about policy responses. The proposed policy response focuses on three key areas: complementing the national Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, positioning Victoria to take advantage of opportunities created by the transition to a carbon-constrained economy, and adapting to the impacts of climate change that can no longer be avoided. The documents also highlight the potential adverse impacts of climate change on community lifestyle, health, and wellbeing, including increased costs of living, health impacts, and insurance costs.

Furthermore, the policy aims to establish a target for greenhouse gas reduction by June 2010.

The documents provide several examples of such criteria, often referred to as 'indicators of success' or 'targets'.

For instance, in the area of solid waste management, success is defined by the development of targets for waste reduction, a decrease in waste generation from Council offices by 15% compared to a 2010 baseline, and an increase in the proportion of waste recycled to 85%, among other criteria. Similarly, in the area of sustainable water use, success is marked by a 20% reduction in water consumption in Council buildings and operations compared to a 2009/2010 baseline, and the establishment of low water use gardens throughout public spaces in the municipality. These specific, measurable criteria provide a clear framework for evaluating the success of the policy's proposed actions.",
