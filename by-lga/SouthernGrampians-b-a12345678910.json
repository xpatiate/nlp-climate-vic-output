The policy aims to enable people, businesses, infrastructure, and the environment to adapt to an increasingly variable and volatile climate. The plan sets out priority risks and action areas for the next ten years, including those relevant to the community and council operations. The objectives of the plan include leading the community and businesses to build resilience and proactively consider climate risk, and working with key financial partners to increase consideration of climate risk. The policy also outlines specific adaptation actions, such as facilitating improved community resilience, developing an Integrated Water Plan, and investigating modification of construction practices for road and council infrastructure. Each action includes details of relevant risks, timelines, action ownership, resources required, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)."

The Climate Change Adaptation Plan is designed to enable the local community, businesses, infrastructure, and environment to cope with an increasingly variable and volatile climate. The plan acknowledges the broad-ranging impacts of climate change in the Shire, and emphasizes the necessity of adaptation. The plan sets out priority risks and action areas for the next ten years, including both short-term and long-term actions. The plan also outlines six prioritized adaptation actions, each with a range of sub-actions, and provides implementation details for each. These actions are designed to address various aspects of climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, community resilience, water management, construction practices, and more. The plan also includes a commitment to working in partnership to respond to risks that cross organizational boundaries.",

However, these actions are planned over a span of several years, with timelines extending up to 2027. The documents also discuss the importance of education and awareness in relation to climate change, but again, there is no explicit call for urgent action.

Another action, 'Develop an Urban Forest and Open Space Assets Strategy', has a timeline of 2-3 years for establishment, then ongoing. The action to 'Facilitate improved community resilience and social connectedness' is ongoing with a 12-month timeline. The 'Integrated Water Plan' has an ongoing timeline with annual reporting.

The Southern Grampians Shire Council's Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2017-2027 outlines a range of adaptation actions to respond to climate risks, including research, policy and design, structural changes, and behavioural changes. It also mentions the prioritisation of adaptation actions, but this seems to be in relation to the severity of the climate risks themselves, rather than in comparison to other non-climate-related policies. The documents also detail the council's commitment to improving its preparedness and response to natural disasters, and to working in partnership to respond to risks that cross organisational boundaries. However, none of this information suggests that a climate emergency response is given higher priority than other policies."

These actions include research to improve understanding of climate change and risks, policy and design to prevent or mitigate effects, structural actions to prevent effects through built solutions and maintenance, and behavioural actions to raise awareness among stakeholders. However, there is no explicit requirement stated that all council activities must align with this climate policy. The documents do indicate that the council is committed to implementing adaptation solutions that are cost-effective, sustainable, transparent, justifiable, equitable, and minimise adverse environmental impacts. But again, this does not equate to a mandate for all council activities to align with the climate policy."

Similarly, the 'Biodiversity Officer' is designated as the 'Action Owner' for monitoring high impact invasive species that can negatively impact ecosystems. The plan also mentions the establishment of internal and external partnerships, indicating a collaborative approach to climate change adaptation involving various stakeholders.
