          "answer": "The policy, titled 'Climate Emergency Response Plan 2021-2031', clearly indicates that climate action is the core purpose or goal. The policy outlines a comprehensive plan to address climate change, focusing on mitigation, adaptation, and influence. Mitigation refers to actions that reduce emissions, adaptation involves changes in natural or human systems to prepare for climate changes, and influence refers to actions that contribute towards mitigation and adaptation. The policy also emphasizes the urgency of the climate crisis and the need for immediate and significant action. The community's views are taken into account, with a strong desire for action, particularly in renewable energy. The policy also outlines plans for a Climate Emergency Response Plan Community Hub, which will provide up-to-date information, training, and education on the climate emergency.",

The document cites the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which warns of a limited time frame (12 years from 2018) to prevent a climate crisis. The document also outlines the significant risks posed by climate change, such as drought, floods, extreme heat, and climate-related poverty, further emphasizing the need for immediate action.

While the documents do express concerns about climate change impacts on the natural environment, rising sea levels, erosion, and habitat destruction, they do not specifically address how these impacts might disproportionately affect vulnerable communities. The documents also mention the community's desire to reduce the impacts of climate change on people, including future generations, but they do not delve into the specific impacts on vulnerable communities or discuss these impacts in the context of equity and social justice."

While the policy does mention various aspects of climate change response, including renewable energy, sustainable buildings, sustainable transport, mobilisation, education and collaboration, adaptation and resilience, consumption and waste, and environmental regeneration, it does not provide specific details on how these benefits and opportunities will be shared equitably among different groups. The policy does mention community engagement and collaboration, but it does not explicitly address the issue of equity and social justice in the context of climate change response."
