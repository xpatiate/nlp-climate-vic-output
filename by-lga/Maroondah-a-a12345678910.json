The policy outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change, including both mitigation and adaptation strategies. The policy objectives include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, building resilience in infrastructure and communities, and managing natural resources to promote their resilience. The policy also outlines specific actions to be taken, such as planning for climate change risks, seeking partnerships for climate change adaptation, and using the natural environment to build adaptive capacity. The policy also emphasizes the importance of 'leading by example' and working together with others to adapt to the challenges of a changing climate. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is not just a component, but a central goal of the policy.",

          "answer": "The documents do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate. While the documents do mention the concept of 'intergenerational equity considerations' and the importance of 'fairness of justice between generations', they do not provide specific details on how the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate will be shared equitably. The documents focus more on the strategies and actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change, such as upscaling stormwater reuse, enhancing energy efficiency, adopting integrated transport, and fostering urban greening. However, these strategies are not explicitly linked to the equitable sharing of benefits and opportunities. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that there is a clear plan or policy for the equitable sharing of the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate."
