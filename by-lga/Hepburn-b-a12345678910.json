The policy also mentions the promotion of new building innovations that value practical solutions over fashionable ones, which could be interpreted as a call for technological solutions that are effective in reducing emissions rather than simply being trendy. Furthermore, the policy emphasizes the importance of climate adaptation, which involves changes in processes, practices, and structures to moderate potential damages or benefit from opportunities associated with climate change.
