The policy outlines a series of actions and strategies aimed at reducing emissions in various sectors, including the workplace, waste management, and building operations. The policy also includes a commitment to monitor and evaluate progress towards these goals. While the policy does not explicitly state that 'climate action' is its core purpose, the focus on emissions reduction and the implementation of strategies to achieve this goal align with the broader objectives of climate action. Therefore, it can be inferred that climate action is a core purpose of the policy.",

For instance, the policy mentions the continuation of using the internal Green Team to raise awareness and encourage change, facilitating staff education sessions to encourage low carbon behaviours, and reporting on the status of emissions reduction projects being implemented, all of which are planned for each year from 2018 to 2021.

While the council acknowledges its role in assisting the community to reduce emissions in the Environmental Sustainability Strategy 2017-2021, it is stated that this is outside the scope of the current plan.
