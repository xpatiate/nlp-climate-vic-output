The policy outlines the local government's commitment to addressing the climate emergency through mitigation, adaptation, and mobilisation strategies. It sets specific targets such as achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions and sourcing 100% of its electricity from renewable energy sources. The policy also includes a commitment to develop a new action plan every two years to respond to emerging climate projections and innovations. Furthermore, the policy acknowledges the impacts of climate change on the local environment, such as increased severe weather events and sea level rises, and the need for action to address these impacts. Therefore, it is evident that the core purpose of the policy is climate action.",

          "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the documents do outline various actions and strategies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, they do not specifically address the distribution of benefits and opportunities in an equitable manner. The documents focus on actions such as updating the Corporate Risk Register with recent climate risk data, adapting public health programs to respond to climate change, and working with Aboriginal Parties to protect culturally significant sites. However, these actions do not directly relate to the equitable sharing of benefits and opportunities. Therefore, based on the provided documents, the question cannot be answered in the affirmative."
