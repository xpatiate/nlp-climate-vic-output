          "answer": "The policy clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy is titled 'Darebin Climate Emergency Plan 2017-2022', which indicates that its primary focus is on addressing climate change. The policy outlines several key directions to achieve its goals, including climate emergency mobilisation and leadership, energy efficiency, renewable energy and fuel switching, zero emissions transport, consumption and waste minimisation, fossil fuel divestment, adaptation and resilience, engaging the community, and establishing Climate Emergency Darebin. These directions all relate to climate action, demonstrating that it is the central purpose of the policy. The policy also includes objectives and actions for each of these directions, further emphasizing its commitment to climate action. The policy's emphasis on community engagement and education about climate change also shows that it aims to promote climate action at the community level.",

The Climate Emergency Plan implementation has a current budget allocation of $427,000, which includes $127,000 for direct programs and $300,000 for the purchase of GreenPower. This funding will be reapportioned in line with recommended strategic directions. Additionally, there are resourcing requirements of $20 million for the expansion of the Solar Saver program, divided into two $10 million programs proposed for consideration in the 2018-19 and 2020-21 budgets. These funds would be recouped via the special rates scheme, but there would be a cost to the Darebin budget of borrowing charges. This explicit allocation of funds for climate action demonstrates a clear commitment to addressing climate change."

          "answer": "The documents explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities, emphasizing the concept of 'Climate Justice'. This principle is defined as putting equity and human rights at the center of tackling climate change, considering who in the community will be most impacted by climate change and ensuring they are prioritized when developing climate solutions. The documents identify specific vulnerable groups within the Darebin community, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, recent migrants, low-income households, people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, older residents, and young children. The documents also highlight the risk of social inequality worsening without climate justice, as those who can afford to take action may benefit more from the solutions, leaving others behind. The policy outlines plans to increase climate resilience and energy equity, particularly for low-income households and renters, and to deliver community education and capacity-building campaigns.",

          "positive": true,
          "answer": "The documents do explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate. The policy emphasizes the concept of 'Climate Justice', which involves considering who in the community will be most impacted by climate change and ensuring that they are prioritized when developing climate solutions. This approach is aimed at reducing social inequality and improving social and economic equity in the community. The policy also highlights the importance of a connected and inclusive community in enhancing resilience to climate impacts. The policy further outlines specific actions to increase climate resilience and energy equity in Darebin, particularly focusing on supporting low-income households and renters. This is a clear indication of the policy's commitment to ensuring that the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate are shared equitably.",
