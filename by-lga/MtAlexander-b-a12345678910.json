The policy outlines the local government's commitment to integrating climate change considerations across its operations and advocating for climate action within the community. The policy's goals include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, becoming carbon neutral by 2025, and implementing adaptation measures to manage climate risks and vulnerabilities. The policy also outlines specific actions to achieve these goals, such as implementing the Regional Climate Adaptation Plan, developing and implementing a Climate Change Action Plan, and managing the impacts of extreme weather events. The policy also emphasizes the importance of monitoring and reporting on its climate action efforts, indicating a commitment to transparency and accountability in achieving its climate action goals.",
