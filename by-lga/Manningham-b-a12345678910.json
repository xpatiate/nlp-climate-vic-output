          "answer": "The core purpose of the policy, as outlined in the Manningham Council's Climate Emergency Response Plan, is indeed climate action. The policy is designed to address climate change in the Manningham area through increased climate action. The policy aims to enhance the liveability of Manningham, promote community health and well-being, and boost the resilience of natural and built environments, as well as the economy. The policy outlines a commitment to ambitious aspirational climate mitigation or greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. The policy also emphasizes the importance of community involvement and feedback in shaping and implementing climate actions. The policy's commitment to climate action is further demonstrated by its provision for annual monitoring and reporting on climate actions and greenhouse gas emissions levels.",

This suggests that the allocation of funding is flexible and will be determined on a yearly basis, depending on the climate actions that are prioritized each year.

The government has also conducted a Gender Impact Assessment (GIA) to understand how different genders and socio-economic groups are affected by climate change and their capacity to take climate action. This information is used to refine the actions in the Climate Emergency Response Plan. Furthermore, the government plans to develop an implementation plan in 2023, which will detail the actions in the Climate Emergency Response Plan.
