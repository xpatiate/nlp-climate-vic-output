          "answer": "The core purpose of the policy is indeed climate action. The policy is designed to guide the City of Ballarat and its community towards achieving net zero emissions by 2030. This is a clear commitment to climate action, as reducing emissions is a key strategy in mitigating the impacts of climate change. The policy outlines specific action areas, including Net Zero Business, Net Zero Homes, Net Zero New Developments, Net Zero Transport, and Net Zero Waste. These areas indicate a comprehensive approach to climate action, encompassing various sectors of the community. The policy also acknowledges the need for collaboration with other levels of government and the community, further emphasizing the centrality of climate action to its purpose. The policy's commitment to annual reporting and a review in 2025 demonstrates a serious, ongoing commitment to its climate action goals.",

These include advocating for zero emissions vehicles, supporting businesses to plan for and deliver net zero, developing low emissions infrastructure, and coordinating transport logistics. While these actions indirectly contribute to the welfare of all community members, including potentially vulnerable groups, there is no specific mention or discussion of the differential impacts of climate change on such groups or explicit strategies to address these in terms of equity and social justice."

          "answer": "The provided documents from the Ballarat 2022 Net Zero Emissions Plan do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. The documents focus on the City of Ballarat's plans and actions towards achieving net zero emissions, including advocating for higher environmentally sustainable design standards, promoting incentives for zero emissions vehicles, and supporting businesses to plan for and deliver net zero. While these actions may indirectly contribute to equity and social justice by promoting a healthier environment for all, there is no specific mention of how these benefits and opportunities will be equitably shared among different social groups. Therefore, based on the provided context, the question cannot be answered in the affirmative."
