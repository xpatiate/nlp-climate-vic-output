It also emphasizes the role of the local government in leading and promoting climate action within the community. The policy outlines specific roles for the community and the Shire, and sets out metrics for tracking progress. It also highlights the need for action at the state, national, and global levels, and the importance of partnerships and collaboration in achieving advocacy targets.

          "answer": "The documents indeed refer to specific regional associations, alliances, or other partnerships related to climate. The local government policy emphasizes the importance of collaboration and partnerships in addressing climate change. It mentions the need to work with individuals, businesses, community groups, and the Shire to achieve advocacy targets. The policy also highlights the importance of expanding partnership and collaboration networks and advocating with other government agencies for zero carbon energy. Furthermore, the policy outlines plans to leverage existing connections and bolster new partnerships with community groups, businesses, non-governmental agencies, and intergovernmental alliances. The policy also mentions the Western Alliance for Greenhouse Action as a specific partnership. This suggests a clear recognition of the importance of regional and wider collaborations in addressing climate change.",

          "answer": "The documents do explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. They highlight that climate change will bring increased frequency and severity of natural disasters and extreme weather events such as bushfires, storms, flooding, and heatwaves. These events will increase the need to support displaced people, which will strain emergency response resources. The documents specifically mention that vulnerable communities, including the elderly, disabled, and young, are identified as those most at risk to the impacts of increased temperatures. The policy also outlines plans to provide education and advice to help the community better prepare for climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes community engagement programs that focus on reaching those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.",

          "answer": "The documents provided do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While there are mentions of community engagement, education programs, and support for community-led initiatives, these do not specifically address the equitable distribution of benefits and opportunities. The documents focus more on the mitigation of climate change impacts, preparation for extreme weather events, and the promotion of sustainable practices. There is no clear evidence of a policy or plan that directly addresses the equitable sharing of benefits and opportunities arising from a safe climate."
