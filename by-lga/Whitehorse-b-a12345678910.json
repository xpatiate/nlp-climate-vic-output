The policy outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change, including mitigation, adaptation, and systemic actions. It includes specific actions, such as developing and implementing a climate response communication and training program, advocating for a stronger climate response, and integrating climate change information across all areas of Council’s operations. The policy also outlines a plan for tracking progress and sharing success stories, indicating a commitment to transparency and accountability in its climate action efforts. The policy's focus on climate action is further emphasized by its commitment to updating relevant plans, strategies, and policies to ensure they deliver on environmental sustainability and climate response."

They highlight the local and global impacts of climate change, including increased stormwater runoff, flash flooding, damage to buildings and infrastructure, pressure on emergency services, heat-related deaths, loss of biodiversity, and interruptions to supply chains and food production. The documents emphasize that climate action is essential and urgent to minimize these impacts, reduce emissions to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and achieve the Whitehorse 2040 Community Vision. The documents also underscore the importance of collective effort, collaboration, and partnerships in addressing climate change. They outline specific actions that the local government plans to take, such as integrating climate change and sustainability information across all areas of Council’s operations, advocating for stronger climate response and increased adaptation funding, and ensuring that Council-owned buildings, infrastructure, and services are resilient to climate change impacts.",

The documents also reference the Paris Climate Agreement, which calls for limiting the global average temperature rise in this century to well below two degrees, while attempting to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. For this to be achieved, global emissions need to be controlled and peak by 2025, then reduce by at least 43 per cent by 2030.

The local government's policy outlines a strategy to establish and maintain partnerships and memberships that support the fast-following of new emissions reduction, climate risk mitigation, and sustainability technology and initiatives. This strategy is systemic and ongoing, indicating a commitment to long-term collaboration. The documents also mention specific external partners such as ALGA (Australian Local Government Association), MAV (Municipal Association of Victoria), EAGA (Eastern Alliance for Greenhouse Action), SV (Sustainability Victoria), RV (Renewable Victoria), VGA (Victorian Greenhouse Alliances), and ERG (Energy Rating Guide). These partnerships and collaborations are crucial for sharing resources, knowledge, and best practices, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of climate response actions.",

          "answer": "The documents do explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. The policy outlines plans to identify communities that are vulnerable to climate change impacts and to support them in increasing their resilience. This is a clear recognition of the differential impacts of climate change on different segments of the population, particularly those who are most vulnerable. The policy also mentions leveraging existing and new community partnerships to connect low-income, hard-to-reach, and vulnerable households to sustainability programs and services, such as energy efficiency retrofitting schemes. This indicates an understanding of the intersection between social justice and climate change, and a commitment to ensuring that climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts are inclusive and equitable.",

          "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the documents do outline various strategies and actions related to climate change adaptation and mitigation, they do not specifically address the distribution of benefits and opportunities in an equitable manner. The documents focus more on the practical aspects of climate response, such as leveraging community programs, updating municipal plans, and advocating for stronger climate responses. However, they do not delve into the social justice implications of these actions or how they might contribute to a more equitable distribution of climate benefits and opportunities."
