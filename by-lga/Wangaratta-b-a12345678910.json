The policy outlines a broad range of focus areas and priority areas, including building environmentally sustainable communities, reducing waste, enhancing resource recovery, and protecting waterways, among others. Climate action is one of these focus areas, but it is not singled out as the primary or central goal. The policy also emphasizes the need to address climate risks and the impacts of climate change on all aspects of council operations and community life, but again, this is part of a broader approach to environmental sustainability and community wellbeing, rather than the core purpose of the policy."

They highlight the urgency of addressing climate change, recognizing it as an imperative issue that influences all aspects of council operations and community life. The documents identify climate change as a key environmental challenge, along with unsustainable resource use, pest plants and animals, changes to land use, loss of habitat, water resource availability, soil health issues, and adverse weather events. The recent 2020 bushfires are cited as a stark reminder of the impacts of climate change, emphasizing the urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for future generations. The documents also acknowledge the need to increase community resilience to mitigate and adapt to climate changes, which will affect many health pillars identified in the Municipal Health & Wellbeing Plan. Therefore, the documents explicitly explain the need for action on climate change.",
