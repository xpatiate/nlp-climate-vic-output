The policy's primary goal is to address the challenges of climate change and to reduce the local government's emissions by 30% by 2020. The policy outlines a Climate Change Action Plan that assesses and explores the impact of climate change on the city's systems, including water supply, transport, communications, energy services, emergency services, and the built environment. The policy also acknowledges the need to look beyond the 2020 target for future emissions reductions. The policy's focus on climate action is further emphasized by its identification of key climate change risks, including less rainfall, more chance of drought, extreme heatwaves and bushfires, more intense rainfall and wind storms, and sea level rise.",

          "answer": "The documents provided do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the documents do outline various strategies and plans related to climate change adaptation and mitigation, they do not specifically address the distribution of benefits and opportunities in an equitable manner. The documents focus more on the technical and strategic aspects of climate change, such as reducing emissions, adapting to climate risks, and investing in clean technology. They also mention the importance of community engagement and the role of local government in climate change action. However, they do not delve into the specifics of how these benefits and opportunities will be shared equitably among different social groups or how social justice will be ensured in the process."
