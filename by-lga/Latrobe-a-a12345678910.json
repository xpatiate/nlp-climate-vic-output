          "answer": "The policy, 'Positioning Latrobe City for a Low Carbon Emissions Future', is primarily focused on climate action. The core purpose of the policy is to transition the local economy to a low carbon future. This is evident in the policy's commitment to realizing opportunities for a successful transition to a low carbon emissions future. The policy is proactive and independent of the Australian Government's policy, allowing the Council to take the lead in this transition. The policy is also underpinned by three themes, one of which is 'Pursuing and realizing opportunities' for a low carbon future. The policy contains 30 actions, the majority of which have been implemented, demonstrating the Council's commitment to this transition. The policy was developed in response to the anticipated effects of a price on carbon emissions on the local community and economy.",

The policy 'Positioning Latrobe City for a Low Carbon Emissions Future' was adopted in 2010 with the aim of transitioning to a low carbon economy. The policy was developed in response to the Australian Government's consideration of a price on carbon emissions, indicating an understanding of the economic and environmental implications of carbon emissions. The policy is underpinned by three themes, one of which is 'Pursuing and realising opportunities', suggesting a proactive approach to the challenges and opportunities presented by a low carbon future. The policy also includes a commitment to work with the government of the day to achieve the best possible outcome for the community, demonstrating an ongoing commitment to addressing climate change. The policy's actions were assessed against the Victorian Governmentâ€™s White Paper on Climate Change and were found to be relevant and complementary, further indicating the policy's alignment with broader climate change action.",

While they detail the local government's proactive approach to transitioning to a low carbon economy, the emphasis is more on the economic opportunities and job creation associated with this transition, rather than the urgency of addressing climate change. The documents discuss the adoption and implementation of a low carbon policy, the establishment of a Low Carbon Emissions Future Transition Committee, and the completion of specific action items related to this policy. However, these actions are framed in terms of economic development and structural adjustment, rather than urgent climate action. The documents also mention the Australian Government's carbon emissions reduction legislation and the introduction of a price on carbon, but these are presented as external factors influencing the local government's policy, rather than urgent imperatives for action."

While the council has shown a strong commitment to transitioning to a low carbon economy, as evidenced by the adoption of the policy 'Positioning Latrobe City for a Low Carbon Emissions Future' and the establishment of a Low Carbon Emissions Future Transition Committee, there is no specific mandate that all council activities must align with this policy. The council has indeed taken proactive steps, such as working on specific projects and collaborating with various stakeholders, to address climate change and reduce carbon emissions. However, these actions seem to be part of a broader strategy rather than a requirement for all council activities."

It also mentions the Australian Government's proposed shift from a carbon tax to an Emissions Trading Scheme and the Direct Action Plan, which aims to source low-cost emissions reductions.

The policy seems to rely more on qualitative assessments of success, such as the development of a clear list of priorities, working constructively and collaboratively, and inspiring others to prepare for a low carbon emissions future.
