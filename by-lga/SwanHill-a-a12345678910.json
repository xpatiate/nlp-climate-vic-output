It outlines the local government's strategic tasks related to climate change, such as facilitating community efforts to adapt to climate change, developing a mechanism to measure greenhouse gas emissions, and working with stakeholders to develop a coordinated approach to climate variability adaptation and mitigation. The document also acknowledges the challenges facing rural communities, such as climate change, both short and longer term fluctuations, and the need for agricultural sector restructuring in response to domestic and global market forces. These challenges, while restricting community capacity to achieve sustainability, are seen as providing substantial new opportunities for innovation and capacity building.
