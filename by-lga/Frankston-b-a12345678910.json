The policy aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to low carbon fuel sources, and achieve zero net emissions (carbon neutrality) by 2025. The policy outlines a range of actions to achieve these goals, including energy efficiency measures, renewable energy initiatives, and partnerships for low carbon alternatives. The policy also acknowledges the co-benefits of these actions, such as reduced energy costs, resource conservation, and improved comfort for building occupants. The policy is framed as a response to the global problem of climate change, and it is clear that climate action is the core purpose of the policy.",
