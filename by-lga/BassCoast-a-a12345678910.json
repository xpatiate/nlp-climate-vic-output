The policy also includes a monitoring framework to ensure effective and efficient delivery of the plan. The policy is designed to guide the actions of the council, businesses, households, and farms in mitigating and adapting to climate change. It also emphasizes the importance of community engagement in climate action.",

It also plans to leverage available state and federal government assistance for housing upgrades. The policy emphasizes fairness and equity, and plans to overcome barriers to change such as language, lack of capital, and not owning their home."

It outlines a plan to deliver targeted financial and advisory services to vulnerable households, such as the elderly, rentals, and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities. The aim is to help these groups respond to climate change impacts, focusing on social connectedness to improve social resilience to climate change, and linking to finance for low-cost, high-impact housing improvements to reduce energy costs and increase comfort. The document acknowledges that without targeted assistance, these vulnerable groups could miss out on the benefits of climate change action and be unfairly disadvantaged with household costs and exposure to extreme weather. The policy also plans to leverage available state and federal government assistance for housing upgrades and link with existing council and other local social services and programs."
