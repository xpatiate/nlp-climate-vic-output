          "answer": "The policy, titled 'Climate Emergency Action Plan', clearly indicates that climate action is the core purpose or goal. The policy outlines the local government's planned actions in response to climate change, with a focus on reducing emissions and adapting to climate change. The policy also provides a timeframe for the actions, indicating short, medium, and long-term goals. It also outlines the expected impact of these actions in terms of emissions reduction by 2030. The policy further emphasizes the role of the council and the community in implementing these actions, indicating a comprehensive approach to climate action. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it can be concluded that climate action is indeed the core purpose or goal of the policy.",

          "answer": "The document explicitly discusses the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. It acknowledges that climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities, including low-income households. Factors such as limited access to resources, socio-economic disadvantage, and discrimination can amplify vulnerability to climate-related hazards, displacement, and the unequal distribution of the burdens and benefits associated with climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. The policy also emphasizes the importance of community engagement and support in fostering collective action, ensuring equity, and building resilient communities capable of effectively responding to the impacts of climate change. It also mentions the development of community climate change hubs as a dedicated place for residents and businesses to find up-to-date information on adapting to and mitigating climate change.",

          "answer": "The document does discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate. It acknowledges that climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities, including low-income households, and that factors such as limited access to resources, socio-economic disadvantage, and discrimination can amplify vulnerability to climate-related hazards. The policy aims to address these inequalities by setting net zero emissions targets and implementing policies to achieve them. This approach is intended to ensure that the benefits of a low-carbon economy are shared by all.
