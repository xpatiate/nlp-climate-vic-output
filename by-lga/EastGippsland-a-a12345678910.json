The policy is the East Gippsland Shire Council Environmental Sustainability Strategy 2022-2032, and it is built around seven central goals. These goals include conservation of the natural environment and biodiversity, sustainable management of natural resources, community participation in the climate response, respect and alignment with the rights of Traditional Owner Groups, environmental sustainability supporting sustainable economic growth and new job opportunities, growth in the circular economy, and community resilience to respond to increasing climate risk and natural disasters. Climate action is a significant part of the policy, but it is not the sole focus. The policy aims to address a range of environmental and sustainability challenges prevalent across the municipality."
