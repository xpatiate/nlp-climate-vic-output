The policy is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption from Council's operations, in line with the City's commitment to carbon neutrality. The policy outlines a strategic pathway for the City to invest in energy efficiency and renewable technology, with the aim of maximising economic and environmental benefits. The policy is aligned with national and state climate change commitments, including the Paris Agreement and Victoria’s Climate Change Act 2017. The policy also includes specific targets for emissions reduction and renewable energy generation, and outlines a range of initiatives to achieve these targets, such as retrofitting, upgrading and optimising in the Building Improvement Program, and investing in renewable energy technology.",
