The policy is designed to address the climate and ecological emergency, with a focus on reducing emissions and adapting to climate change. The policy outlines specific goals and targets, such as supporting the community to reduce emissions by 40% by 2025 and achieving net zero by 2030. It also includes a commitment to reduce Council’s corporate emissions to achieve net zero by 2025. The policy also outlines a range of actions to achieve these goals, including expanding waste services to reduce waste to landfill, improving sustainable building design, and supporting low emission. The policy also includes a timeframe for these actions, with high priority actions commencing in the next 12 months, medium priority actions by 2023, and low priority actions by 2025."

They highlight the urgency of the situation, stating that the benefits of acting are significant but the opportunity to do so is rapidly diminishing. The documents also emphasize the real, climate-related impacts for Kingston, including the creation of new jobs, cheaper power, reduced air pollution, and enhanced urban forest. The documents further underscore the importance of reducing emissions in line with science-derived targets, supporting the community to reduce emissions, and improving sustainable building design. The documents also note that the Local Government Bill 2018 makes 'mitigation and planning for climate change risks' a legal requirement for Council. Therefore, the documents not only explain the need for action on climate change but also provide a detailed plan for how to achieve this."

It recognizes that these individuals have typically made the least contribution to the problem. The policy emphasizes the need for a just transition, ensuring that the most vulnerable community members are not disadvantaged. This shows a clear understanding of the social justice implications of climate change and a commitment to addressing these in a fair and equitable way. The policy also acknowledges the potential impact of rising electricity and gas prices on the ability of some community members to heat and cool their properties, indicating an awareness of the economic challenges that climate change can pose for vulnerable individuals.",

          "answer": "The document does explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate. It emphasizes the importance of a 'just transition', ensuring that the most vulnerable community members are not disadvantaged. This is a priority of the plan, indicating a commitment to social equity in the face of climate change. The plan also recognizes that the most vulnerable people often have the least capacity to respond and cope with the impacts of climate change, and have typically made the least contribution to the problem. This recognition of inequity is a crucial step towards ensuring that the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate are shared equitably. The plan also mentions the need for capacity building and professional development, which could be interpreted as measures to ensure that all community members have the opportunity to benefit from a safe climate.",
