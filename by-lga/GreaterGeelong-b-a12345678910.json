          "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the documents do outline the local government's plans and strategies for addressing climate change, including setting emissions reduction targets, promoting community involvement, and implementing a coordinated approach, they do not specifically address the distribution of benefits and opportunities in an equitable manner. The documents mention the importance of community involvement and collaboration, the establishment of a Sustainability Advisory Committee, and the implementation of a community climate action partnership fund. However, these references do not directly relate to the equitable sharing of benefits and opportunities. Therefore, based on the provided documents, the question cannot be answered in the affirmative."
