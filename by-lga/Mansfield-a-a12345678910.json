The policy is designed to address the threat of climate change to the community's way of life. It outlines the local government's commitment to mitigating the impacts of climate change within its own operations and supporting the community to reduce municipal greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to a changing climate. The policy includes specific actions to be undertaken by the Council to achieve its goal, targets, and objectives. These actions include renewable power purchase, energy-efficient buildings and solar PV, street lighting upgrades, fleet transition, and the purchase of offsets. The policy also outlines the key community emissions reduction action areas and Council interventions identified to drive community climate action. These areas include transport, residential and commercial energy, agriculture, land use, and waste.",

While the documents do outline the local government's commitment to mitigating climate change impacts and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, they do not specifically address how these efforts will affect or benefit vulnerable communities. The documents mention the development of a Climate Action Plan, the promotion of low emissions transitions, and the advocacy for a supportive policy environment for climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, these actions are not explicitly linked to the concept of 'equity and social justice' or to the impact on vulnerable communities. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that the policy explicitly discusses the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities in terms of 'equity and social justice'."

While the documents do outline the local government's commitment to mitigating the impacts of climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, they do not specifically address the distribution of benefits and opportunities arising from these actions. The documents focus on the technical and strategic aspects of climate action, such as emissions reduction, sustainable transport infrastructure, and energy efficiency. However, they do not delve into the social implications of these actions or how they might contribute to social justice or equity. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that the policy explicitly discusses how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate."
