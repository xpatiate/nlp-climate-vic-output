The policy outlines a comprehensive plan to address climate change, with a focus on both mitigation and adaptation strategies. It sets specific goals such as achieving net zero emissions in Council operations by 2030 and a 2035 net zero emissions target for the community. The policy also identifies eight focus areas for proactive climate action. The policy is accompanied by a clear implementation schedule and a commitment to evaluate and report on its progress at regular intervals. The policy also emphasizes the importance of embedding climate action into the Council's day-to-day operations and decision-making processes. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is the core purpose of this policy.",

While the documents do mention the impacts of climate change on health and wellbeing, and the need to support vulnerable community members, they do not specifically address the differential impacts on vulnerable communities or discuss these impacts in the context of equity and social justice. The documents focus more on the general impacts of climate change on the community and the environment, and the local government's plans for mitigation and adaptation."

          "answer": "The provided documents from the Nillumbik 2022 Climate Action Plan do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the documents do outline various strategies and actions related to climate change adaptation and mitigation, such as promoting climate action leadership, creating a climate resilient community, and managing health impacts of extreme weather events, there is no specific mention of how these benefits and opportunities will be distributed equitably among different social groups. The documents also do not address issues of social justice in relation to climate change. Therefore, based on the provided documents, the answer to the question is negative."
