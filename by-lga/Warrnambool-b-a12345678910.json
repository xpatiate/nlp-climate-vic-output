The policy outlines the local government's commitment to addressing climate change, as evidenced by the Climate Change Action Plan. This plan details the council's target of reducing emissions by 30% by 2020 and the need to look beyond this for future emissions reductions. The policy also identifies four key climate change risks and assesses their impact on the city's systems. Furthermore, the policy outlines the council's commitment to sustainable building design, the development of a 'Climate Capable City' information program, and the creation of a Zero Carbon Neighbourhood. These actions demonstrate a clear focus on climate action as the core purpose of the policy.",
