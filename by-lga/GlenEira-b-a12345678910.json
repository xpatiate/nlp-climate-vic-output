          "answer": "The policy, titled 'Our Climate Emergency Response Strategy 2021–2025', clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy outlines a comprehensive plan to integrate climate action into all aspects of the local government's operations. It sets out 70 actions to be undertaken over the life of the strategy to achieve the identified goals and objectives. The policy is designed to be broad, capturing a wide range of specific actions, programs, and projects that the Council will undertake over four years. These actions are to be translated each year into specific actions, programs, or projects and integrated into annual work plans across the Council. This approach ensures that climate change action is truly integrated into everything the Council does. The policy also includes a Monitoring and Evaluation section, which contains a set of key questions, indicators, and targets for each goal. This section will be used to track progress and make necessary adjustments to the policy.",

The council acknowledges the current state of climate change and its impacts, and emphasizes the need for immediate action. The council declared a climate emergency in May 2020, demonstrating their recognition of the urgency of the situation. They have committed to work harder to address climate change at a local level and to advocate to State and Federal Governments for urgent action.

The plan also includes the integration of climate change action into relevant position descriptions across the council.

Technological solutions are also mentioned, such as the installation of solar panels to generate clean renewable energy on-site.

          "answer": "The documents provided by the Glen Eira City Council do explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. The council's Climate Emergency Response Strategy 2021-2025 outlines a number of measures aimed at supporting vulnerable populations in the face of climate change. These include understanding the needs and barriers to action of population segments particularly exposed to climate change risks, investing in services and partnerships to support the most vulnerable community members, and engaging and educating residents and business owners about how they can best adapt to and protect themselves and their community against climate impacts. The council also plans to provide an annual progress report on key programs and outcomes, including the number of vulnerable people supported. This indicates a clear recognition of the differential impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities and a commitment to addressing these impacts."

          "answer": "The documents from Glen Eira City Council's Climate Emergency Response Strategy 2021–2025 do explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate. The policy outlines a commitment to inclusivity and health, acknowledging that climate change directly impacts human health and wellbeing, and that certain segments of the community are particularly vulnerable. These include older people, low-income households, people with chronic illnesses, women, and homeless people. The council plans to provide a diversity of climate action opportunities to meet the differing needs and capacities within the community. The policy also mentions the goal of providing equitable access to green open spaces, which are crucial for a healthy community and are already being impacted by climate change. The council plans to work in collaboration with the community to achieve this. These actions indicate a commitment to social justice and equity in the face of climate change.",
