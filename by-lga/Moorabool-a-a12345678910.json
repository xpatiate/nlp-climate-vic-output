The policy outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change, including understanding and mitigating climate risks to the council and its community, reducing greenhouse emissions, improving water efficiency, and promoting local food supply. The policy also acknowledges the need for flexibility in response to changes in environmental policy and funding opportunities at all levels of government. The policy's strategic objectives for climate adaptation include understanding the risks of climate change on Council operations and the community, and taking actions to prepare for and mitigate these risks. The policy also emphasizes the importance of community engagement in reducing the impacts of climate change.",

The document emphasizes the need for the Council to plan for these impacts, understand the climate risks to the council and its community, and take steps to mitigate these risks. It also highlights the need to reduce greenhouse emissions, improve water efficiency, and ensure a more localized food supply. The document further underscores the importance of reducing the community's and businesses' emissions and energy costs, and facilitating access to renewable energy. The document's explicit call for action is grounded in the recognition of the severe and increasing impacts of climate change, and the need to mitigate these impacts through strategic planning and action."

The policy outlines a number of ways in which the council plans to respond to climate change, including understanding and mitigating climate risks, reducing greenhouse emissions, and improving water efficiency. The policy also mentions the use of 'skilled staff to prepare and implement suitable projects and programs', which suggests that staff resources are being allocated to these climate action initiatives. However, the policy does not provide specific details on the number of staff or the exact nature of their roles in these initiatives.

The policy outlines a number of strategic objectives and actions that involve the community in mitigating the impacts of climate change. These include understanding the climate risks to the community and working with them to prepare for and mitigate these risks, developing a Water & Energy Efficient Communities engagement strategy to promote existing State Government programs that assist the community to reduce greenhouse emissions and improve water efficiency, and increasing community awareness of the local natural values in Moorabool Shire.

Technological solutions include reducing the council's corporate greenhouse emissions, utilizing renewable energy production at council-owned facilities, and improving water efficiency. The policy also encourages behaviour change, such as assisting the community and businesses to cut their emissions and energy costs, promoting the use of renewable energy, and encouraging a more localized food supply. The policy also aims to reduce greenhouse emissions from vehicle usage for council operations and staff travel. The strategy is to achieve a carbon-neutral council by 2031, indicating a clear commitment to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions."
