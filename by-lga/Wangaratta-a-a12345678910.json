The policy outlines a broad range of focus areas and priority areas, including building environmentally sustainable communities, reducing waste, enhancing resource recovery, and protecting waterways. Climate action is one of these focus areas, but it is not singled out as the primary goal. The policy also acknowledges that the impacts of climate change influence all aspects of council operations and community life, indicating a holistic approach to policy planning rather than a singular focus on climate action."

The policy outlines several actions that would require the allocation of staff resources. For instance, the policy mentions the need to 'identify opportunities for green/blue infrastructure development', 'consider the impacts of climate change on storm events when planning renewal of infrastructure', and 'update relevant Council plans with sustainable stormwater management considerations'. These actions imply the involvement of staff in planning, implementing, and managing these initiatives. Furthermore, the policy also mentions the continuation of the 'staff Eco Leaders team to increase awareness and actions regarding environmental sustainability', which directly points to the allocation of staff resources for climate action.
