The policy is designed to address the climate and ecological emergency, with a vision to leverage Council resources and spheres of influence to support and accelerate the community response to the Climate Emergency and remove barriers to change. The policy outlines specific goals and targets related to climate action, such as reducing emissions, transitioning to sustainable transport, and adapting to the impacts of climate change. The policy also acknowledges the need for a high level of urgency in addressing climate change, and it includes a timeline for implementing actions. The policy's focus on climate action is further emphasized by its commitment to principles such as science-based targets, community engagement, and ongoing monitoring and evaluation.",

          "answer": "The documents do explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. The policy acknowledges that the most vulnerable people often have the least capacity to respond and cope with the impacts of climate change. It recognizes that these individuals have typically made the least contribution to the problem. The policy emphasizes the need for a just transition, ensuring that the most vulnerable community members are not disadvantaged. This indicates an understanding of the disproportionate impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations and a commitment to addressing these inequities. The policy also mentions the threat posed by increasing frequency and severity of heatwaves to vulnerable members of the community, including the elderly and those on low incomes. This further demonstrates an awareness of the specific risks faced by vulnerable communities due to climate change.",

          "answer": "The documents do explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate. The policy recognizes the importance of a just transition, particularly for the most vulnerable community members who often have less capacity to respond and cope with the impacts of climate change. The policy emphasizes that any major transition needs to occur in a fair and socially equitable way, ensuring that the most vulnerable community members are not disadvantaged. This is a priority of the plan. The policy also acknowledges that pandemic recovery represents a unique opportunity to address the threats of climate change and that each of the priority areas in their action plan presents opportunities to build back better, support pathways to employment for young people, modernize manufacturing, support local food and beverage production, and generate commercial and professional service opportunities in the industries of the future.",
