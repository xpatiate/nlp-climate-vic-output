          "answer": "The core purpose of the policy, as stated in the document, is indeed climate action. The policy is designed to provide the Council with a strategic framework for mitigating and adapting to climate change. This is achieved through a variety of strategies, including reducing environmental impacts and operating costs, transitioning to renewable energy, and achieving net zero emissions by specific target dates. The policy also aims to reduce community emissions and increase public engagement, education, and action on climate change. Furthermore, the policy outlines plans to respond to the risks of climate change to Council assets and services and assist the community in becoming more resilient to the effects of climate change. Therefore, it is clear that the core purpose of the policy is to take action on climate change."

It acknowledges the scientific evidence and the risk that climate change presents to the community and the planet. The policy outlines the council's strategic framework for mitigating and adapting to climate change, with objectives such as reducing environmental impacts and operating costs, transitioning to renewable energy, and achieving net zero emissions. The policy also emphasizes the need for public engagement, education, and action to reduce community emissions. Furthermore, the document recognizes that the Gannawarra is particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and needs to commence early measures to increase the municipalitiesâ€™ resilience. It also highlights the potential for Gannawarra to become a top renewable energy producing municipality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and shifting to 100% renewables."

While the policy outlines a strategic framework for mitigating and adapting to climate change, and sets specific goals for transitioning to renewable energy and achieving net zero emissions, the language used does not convey a sense of urgency or immediacy. The policy does acknowledge the risks of climate change and the need for action, but the timelines given (achieving corporate net zero emissions by 2025, net zero emissions at the Landfill by 2040, and a 50% reduction in community emissions by 2030) suggest a measured, long-term approach rather than an urgent, immediate response. The policy also states that it will be reviewed initially within twelve months of its adoption and thereafter as required, but always within twelve months of a general election of the Council, which does not suggest an urgent approach."

Furthermore, the policy aims to support the community towards achieving a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2040. These specific timeframes indicate a sense of urgency in the policy's approach to addressing climate change. The policy also mentions regular reviews of strategies, plans, policies, and procedures, where their content may be affected by climate change, to ensure currency as the science develops.
