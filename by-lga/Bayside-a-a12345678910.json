The policy is designed to identify actions that the Council will take to respond to the Climate Emergency and to support the local community in reducing their impact on the environment. The policy includes actions to both minimize greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) and reduce vulnerability (adaptation) to the impacts of climate change. The policy also emphasizes the Council's role as a leader and advocate for change across other tiers of government, and its role to encourage and facilitate community participation and collaboration. The policy also outlines a commitment to making the Climate Emergency one of the highest priorities, leveraging resources to respond to the Climate Emergency, and making decisions based on the best available evidence to address the economic, social, and environmental impacts of climate change.",

For instance, the 'Climate Emergency Action Plan' outlines several actions with clear deadlines. Action 1.8, which involves reviewing and updating the Risk Management Framework to ensure climate risks are appropriately assessed and managed, is set to be completed by June 2025. Similarly, Action 1.9, which includes the consideration of the response to the 'Climate Emergency' in all reports to Council, is marked as 'Ongoing'. Action 1.10, which involves reporting on Council’s response to the 'Climate Emergency' through Council’s Quarterly Reporting to the community, is to be done annually. These examples demonstrate that the policy document does not only state the actions to be taken but also provides specific timeframes for their implementation, thus emphasizing the urgency of action."

The budget source for most of these actions is listed as the 'Existing operational budget'. The plan also mentions an additional allocation of $172,880 to purchase carbon offsets and achieve carbon neutrality from 2020. Furthermore, the plan explores innovative funding models to support investment in climate action, such as the implementation of Environmental Upgrade Finance for local businesses and residential properties. The cost of actions is categorized into low, medium, and high, with low being less than $50,000, medium being between $50,000 and $500,000, and high being more than $500,000.
