          "answer": "The policy under review, the Golden Plains Shire Climate Emergency Plan 2022-2032, clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy was developed in response to the Council's declaration of a Climate Emergency, which called for immediate and urgent action to reverse global warming and adapt to unavoidable changes. The policy outlines the Council's climate mitigation and adaptation priorities for the next decade, with a focus on actions that will reduce emissions and help the community adapt to climate change. The policy is organized into five themes, including embedding climate action into Council, resilient and adaptive community, caring for the land, climate responsive development, and sustainable transport and travel. Each theme includes specific actions, many of which are aimed at reducing emissions (mitigation) or helping adapt to climate change (adaptation). The policy also includes a commitment to work with the community and other organizations to implement the plan.",

For instance, action 1.1, which involves ensuring that Council climate risks are recorded and addressed, is set to start in 2022. Similarly, action 1.3, which involves taking climate change mitigation and adaptation measures into account in new Council building projects, is set to start in 2023.

It acknowledges that climate change risks will have a greater impact on those who are already vulnerable, such as older people, people with disabilities, or those in unsecure housing. The document also highlights the role of the Council in educating and sharing information with residents, schools, and businesses to address the Climate Emergency. The Council plans to use its leadership and resources to partner with the community, other Councils, Traditional Owner groups, and the Barwon South West Climate Alliance to amplify community voices and undertake collective advocacy and action. This indicates a recognition of the need for equity and social justice in climate change policies and actions.",

While the documents do mention the council's role in educating and sharing information with residents, schools, and businesses, and also mention the impact of climate risks on vulnerable groups such as older people, people with disabilities, or those in unsecure housing, they do not provide specific details on how the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate will be shared equitably. The documents focus more on the actions and strategies the council is implementing or planning to implement to address the climate emergency, such as educational programs, workshops, and embedding climate change considerations into council processes."
