          "answer": "The policy under review, the Darebin Climate Emergency Plan 2017-2022, clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy outlines a comprehensive plan to address climate change, with a focus on local, ground-up action. It acknowledges the urgency of the climate emergency and the need for swift, ambitious action. The policy outlines several key directions to achieve its goals, including climate emergency mobilisation and leadership, energy efficiency, renewable energy and fuel switching, zero emissions transport, consumption and waste minimisation, fossil fuel divestment, adaptation and resilience, engaging the community, and establishing Climate Emergency Darebin. These directions indicate a comprehensive approach to climate action, encompassing mitigation, adaptation, and community engagement. The policy also recognises the need for climate justice, ensuring that climate action does not exacerbate social inequality. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is the core purpose of this policy.",

The budget allocation is $427,000, which includes $127,000 for direct programs and $300,000 for the purchase of GreenPower. Additionally, the plan outlines further resourcing requirements, including $20 million for the expansion of the Solar Saver program. This funding is divided into two $10 million programs proposed for consideration in the 2018-19 and 2020-21 budgets. The documents also mention that these funds would be recouped via the special rates scheme, but there would be a cost to the Darebin budget of borrowing charges.

The plan outlines the allocation of staff resources for the implementation of various climate action programs. For instance, the plan mentions the recruitment and administration of special schemes in the preceding year of the Solar Saver program. This indicates that staff resources are being allocated for the implementation of this program. Additionally, the plan also mentions the use of internal communications such as e-newsletters and events to educate staff on climate change policies relevant to their work.

          "answer": "The documents indeed refer to specific regional associations, alliances, or other partnerships related to climate. The Darebin Council has outlined its commitment to climate action through various partnerships and alliances. It has mentioned its participation in alliance-led campaigns and its intention to lead, contribute to, and form new key alliances/networks and cross-sector partnerships. The council also plans to seek partnership opportunities with the Victorian and Australian governments for innovative programs that align with Council priorities. Furthermore, the council has expressed its intention to join the Cities Power Partnership and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. These alliances aim to support, celebrate, and accelerate the climate leadership municipal governments are demonstrating, on the national and international stages respectively. These alliances will amplify the council's ability to share its own models of success with others, and learn from the experiences and innovations of councils around Australia and the world.",

          "positive": true,
          "answer": "The documents explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. The policy acknowledges that climate change impacts are not felt equally across the community, with certain groups being more vulnerable. These include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, recent migrants, low-income households, people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, older residents, and young children. The policy also highlights the concept of 'Climate Justice', which involves prioritizing the most impacted groups when developing climate solutions. This is part of the council's 'Towards Equality Framework'. The policy also mentions the need to increase climate resilience and energy equity in Darebin, particularly for low-income households and renters. Therefore, the policy not only acknowledges the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable communities but also outlines measures to address these disparities.",

          "answer": "The documents do explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate. The policy emphasizes the concept of 'Climate Justice', which involves considering who in the community will be most impacted by climate change and ensuring that they are prioritized when developing climate solutions. The policy identifies specific vulnerable groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, recent migrants, low-income households, people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, older residents, and young children. The policy also outlines plans to deliver community education and capacity-building campaigns on energy literacy and efficiency, food resilience, and water saving, prioritizing areas of Darebin most vulnerable to heat stress and energy inequity. This approach ensures that the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate are shared equitably, particularly among those most at risk.",
