The policy outlines a range of measures aimed at addressing climate change, including monitoring and reporting on the council's energy use, advocating for government leadership in setting greenhouse gas reduction targets, and participating in joint procurement of renewable power. The policy also outlines responses to the impacts of climate change, such as hotter and drier weather, increased demand for water, and more extreme weather events. These responses include measures to protect and enhance biodiversity, upgrade and maintain critical water points, and implement a heatwave plan. The policy also includes a commitment to review and enhance the council's climate change commitment and policy, and to review its procurement policy to encourage sustainable procurement. Therefore, it is clear that the core purpose of the policy is to take action on climate change."

The plan acknowledges the ongoing increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the community's expectation of the council's responsibility to minimize environmental footprint. The 'Heatwave Plan' also acknowledges the impact of climate change, specifically the increase in frequency and intensity of heatwaves. It outlines a strategic action plan to minimize the adverse effects of extreme heat-related events on vulnerable members of the community. These documents demonstrate the local government's recognition of the need for action on climate change and their commitment to implementing measures to mitigate its impacts."
