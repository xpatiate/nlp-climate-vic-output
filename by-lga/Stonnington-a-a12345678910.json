          "answer": "The core purpose of the policy, as outlined in the Stonnington 2021 Climate Emergency Action Plan, is indeed climate action. The policy is designed to address the global climate emergency through local action. It outlines the local government's commitment to climate adaptation and mitigation priorities, with a focus on immediate and urgent action on climate change. The policy is structured around three priorities: reducing emissions (climate mitigation), future-proofing the city (climate adaptation), and a combination of both mitigation and adaptation actions. The policy also outlines a plan for the next four years, detailing actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, prepare the city and community for a changing climate, and embed a climate emergency response throughout the organization. The policy is set to be reviewed in 2024 to include new policies, technology, and feedback from stakeholders.",

The document also mentions that many of the actions are already underway across the organization. Furthermore, it specifies that in 2024, the Council will undertake a review of the action plan and the climate emergency response to update the plan. This suggests a commitment to ongoing action and adaptation in response to changing circumstances. The document also includes a detailed action plan with specific actions, their timeframes, and funding details. For instance, action 3.2.1, which involves reviewing and updating existing strategies, policies, and plans with the Council’s climate emergency response commitments, is scheduled for years 1-2."

However, these actions are not explicitly prioritized over other policy areas. The documents also mention the integration of climate action into all areas of Council control, but again, this does not necessarily imply a higher priority than other policies.

The plan outlines a series of actions, each with a specified timeframe, funding source (new or existing), and cost range. For instance, the plan includes actions such as 'Embed Council’s climate emergency commitment in the next iteration of its Council Plan and Municipal Public Health and Wellbeing Plan' and 'Incorporate climate emergency considerations into decision-making documentation'. These actions are marked as having 'existing' funding, indicating that resources have been allocated. However, the plan does not provide specific monetary values, instead using cost ranges such as '$ Low $0-$50k', '$$ Medium $50k-$250k', and '$$$ High >$250k'. This approach provides some level of financial commitment, but lacks precise detail on the exact amount of funding allocated to each action."

The plan outlines a number of actions that involve the mobilisation of staff and other institutional resources. For instance, the plan includes the establishment of an internal Climate Oversight Committee with key decision-makers to support the integration of climate emergency response into Council decision-making. This indicates a clear allocation of staff resources to climate action. Additionally, the plan outlines the development of a tailored climate action plan for each internal division to support climate response throughout the organisation, which implies the allocation of staff time and expertise. The plan also includes the development and delivery of a climate change education and engagement program for Council staff, which suggests the allocation of institutional resources for staff training and capacity building in relation to climate action."

Technological solutions are evident in the plan's focus on reducing the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal used to power buildings and fuels used in transport. The plan also mentions the development of 'smart cities' initiatives related to environmental performance to monitor performance and inform projects. Behaviour change is encouraged through the plan's emphasis on building climate emergency awareness both internally and externally, and through the inclusion of climate emergency information in Council communications.

While the policy does mention actions to mitigate climate change impacts and increase awareness, it does not provide specific strategies or plans on how the benefits and opportunities resulting from these actions will be equitably distributed among different social groups. The policy does mention the need to consider social, health, economic, and environmental issues, and to provide opportunities for community involvement in decision-making relating to climate change. However, these statements are too general and do not specifically address the equitable sharing of benefits and opportunities of a safe climate."
