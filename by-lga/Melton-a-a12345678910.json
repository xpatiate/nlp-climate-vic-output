The policy is designed to manage the risks of a changing climate, maximise positive outcomes, and build the resilience of the City of Melton. It provides a formal and coordinated climate change adaptation framework and action plan for the future. The policy is organised into five themes: Community Wellbeing and Emergency Management, Open Space and Water Security, Assets and Infrastructure, Planning, Buildings and Regulations, and Governance and Risk. Each theme contains specific actions to address climate change impacts. The policy also outlines the need to update existing strategies, policies, and processes to embed climate change adaptation considerations. Therefore, it is evident that the core purpose of this policy is to take action against climate change.",

They outline a comprehensive Climate Change Adaptation Plan, which is a response to current and anticipated future changes due to climate change. The plan acknowledges that climate change will affect most areas of council operations, services, and functions, and therefore, it is important to embed climate change considerations in relevant strategies and plans. The documents also highlight the need to update existing strategies, policies, and processes to embed climate change adaptation considerations. The plan is designed to be adjustable to changes in circumstances and available information, and it aims to provide maximum net benefit (social, economic, environmental).

For instance, the plan mentions actions such as 'Develop and deliver community education and information on the impacts of climate change' and 'Improve understanding of climate change related exposure to legal and financial risk' with specific timings and resourcing. This indicates a clear timeline for the implementation of the actions, which is crucial for tracking progress and ensuring accountability."

For instance, the 'City Design and Strategy' and 'Environment and Waste' units are tasked with integrating climate change considerations into relevant plans, policies, and processes. The 'Risk and Performance' unit is responsible for reviewing facilities for availability, accessibility, and trigger points for increased hours during extreme weather events. The plan also mentions the establishment of processes and responsibilities for monitoring, evaluating, and reporting on climate change impacts on Council service delivery and operations.
