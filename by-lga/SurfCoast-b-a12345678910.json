          "answer": "The policy clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy is titled 'Climate Emergency Response Plan 2021-2031', which indicates that the primary focus is on addressing climate change. The policy outlines specific goals and objectives related to climate change, such as aligning with climate emergency principles, transitioning from business-as-usual, and contributing to a safe climate. It also includes specific measures and targets for climate action, such as achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions and obtaining 100% of its electricity from renewable energy sources. The policy also acknowledges the impacts of climate change on local operations and services, and outlines plans for mitigation, adaptation, and mobilisation in response to the climate emergency. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is the core purpose of the policy."

The document also acknowledges the impacts of climate change on local operations, such as increased severe weather events and sea level rises affecting open space maintenance. The policy further commits to specific actions, such as purchasing 100% renewable electricity and becoming a carbon neutral organisation in 2021-22. It also sets targets for action completion and reporting, demonstrating a commitment to accountability and progress tracking. The document's emphasis on partnerships with the community, other councils, and agencies underscores the importance of collective action in addressing climate change."

Furthermore, the Council commits to obtaining 100% of its electricity from renewable energy sources, which is a clear technological solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
