The policy outlines a comprehensive plan for the local government to respond to climate change, with a focus on both mitigation and adaptation strategies. The policy includes specific actions, roles, timeframes, responsibilities, outcomes, and indicators, demonstrating a high level of detail and commitment to addressing climate change. The policy also emphasizes the need for community engagement and education, indicating a holistic approach to climate action. The policy's commitment to climate action is further evidenced by its alignment with the Paris Agreement's target of limiting global temperature rise to below 1.5°C. The policy also acknowledges the need for additional measures and funding to implement the strategy, indicating a recognition of the resources required for effective climate action.",
