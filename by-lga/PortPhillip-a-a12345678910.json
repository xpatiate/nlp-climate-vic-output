It outlines a commitment to maintaining zero net emissions from operations and to work with the community and partners to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The policy also acknowledges the need for urgent climate action and the existence of feasible and practical options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and minimize human-caused climate change. The policy further emphasizes the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy as a critical step in tackling the climate emergency. It also highlights the role of the community and businesses in taking meaningful action to reduce their emissions and become more climate resilient.",

The documents highlight the severe risks posed by climate change to the planet, biodiversity, and communities. They emphasize the need for immediate action, stating that humanity has a narrow window to act. The documents also note the growing momentum for climate action at both the individual and community scale, with over 100 local government areas in Australia, including Port Phillip, having declared a climate emergency. The documents further underscore the importance of urgent action by outlining the devastating impacts of climate change that have already been experienced, such as Australia's hottest and driest year on record in 2019 and the largest wildfire ever recorded. The documents also highlight the need for transformative changes in areas such as waste management and the creation of a recycling and circular economy.",

The documents also mention the ongoing strengthening of climate change and environmental policies by the Victorian and Australian Governments, but again, no specific timeframes are given for these actions.

They outline the City of Port Phillip's Sustainable Environment Strategy for 2023-28, which includes initiatives to reduce environmental impact and increase resilience to climate change. The strategy details five priority areas: a water-sensitive city, a greener and more liveable city, a city with lower greenhouse gas emissions, a city that is adapting and resilient to climate change, and a sustained reduction in waste. However, these are strategic priorities rather than a mandate for all council activities to align with climate policy. The documents also mention the council's commitment to monitoring and reporting on climate risks, encouraging community action, and implementing specific actions such as a Coastal Adaptation Plan. However, these are specific actions within the broader strategy, not a requirement for all council activities to align with climate policy."

The policy outlines several initiatives aimed at addressing climate change and improving resilience, and it provides specific monetary allocations for some of these initiatives. For instance, the policy mentions a budget of $3.629 million for implementing the Waste Management Strategy, which includes efforts to reduce waste to landfill and increase recycling. Additionally, the policy allocates $4.844 million for developing a cool spaces strategy and supporting community resilience to climate change. These allocations demonstrate a clear commitment to funding climate action.
