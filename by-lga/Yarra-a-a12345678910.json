          "answer": "The policy's core purpose is indeed climate action. The policy is structured around five strategic priorities, all of which are directly related to climate action. These include mobilizing and enabling the community, accelerating renewable energy and zero carbon buildings, creating a climate-adapted city, transitioning to zero emissions transport, and moving towards zero waste and conscious consumption. The policy outlines specific actions to be taken in each of these areas, such as delivering a new climate program, committing substantial grant funds to stimulate community-driven climate action, and introducing zero carbon standards for new developments. The policy also sets a target of engaging 10,000 people in Yarra to take action on the climate emergency by 2024. Therefore, it is clear that the policy's primary goal is to drive climate action.",

          "answer": "The documents do discuss the equitable sharing of benefits and opportunities of a safe climate, although the specifics of how this will be achieved are not detailed. The policy acknowledges the need for a fair and socially equitable transition to a safe climate, recognizing that the most vulnerable people often have less capacity to respond and cope with climate impacts. The policy also outlines plans to support the most vulnerable in the community to prepare for and cope with extreme climate impacts, including heatwaves, storms, floods, transport disruptions, and power outages. This includes targeted communications and in-home support to older people, those who are unwell, have additional needs, or are living in housing with poor environmental performance. The policy also plans to build the capacity of community organizations to prepare for and respond to climate-related impacts."
