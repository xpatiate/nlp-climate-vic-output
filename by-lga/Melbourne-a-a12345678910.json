          "answer": "The policy under review, the Melbourne 2018 Climate Change Mitigation Strategy, clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy is designed to address the challenges of climate change and outlines a strategic approach to mitigate its impacts. The policy aligns with the Paris Climate Agreement and aims to achieve emission reductions as part of international efforts to avoid a 1.5°C increase in global average temperature. The policy also outlines a plan to measure and report progress annually and evaluate the implementation plan by 2025. It includes actions such as promoting the actions needed to achieve emission reductions to the community, businesses, and government decision-makers, and taking an innovative, transparent, and evidence-based approach. Therefore, it is evident that the core purpose of this policy is climate action.",

It aligns its strategy with the Paris Climate Agreement and the Victorian Climate Change Act 2017, indicating a recognition of the global and local legislative frameworks that mandate action on climate change. The document also refers to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's message that climate change is already impacting communities and that urgent action is needed. The policy outlines a commitment to act on the emissions that cause climate change and sets ambitious emissions reduction targets for 2030, with a goal to achieve net zero emissions before 2050.

They outline a Climate Change Mitigation Strategy to 2050, which suggests a long-term approach rather than immediate urgency. The documents discuss various scenarios, including 'Business as Usual', 'Significant Action', 'Accelerated Action', and 'Purchasing Offsets'. While 'Accelerated Action' might imply a sense of urgency, the documents do not explicitly state that rapid and urgent action is required. Instead, they indicate that the City of Melbourne's preferred approach is to deliver the actions needed to achieve the 'Significant Action' scenario and pursue actions for the 'Accelerated Action' scenario where there is the opportunity to go further. This suggests a measured and strategic approach to climate change mitigation, rather than an urgent one."

For instance, the 'Climate Change Mitigation Strategy to 2050' outlines a plan to facilitate and support corporate Power Purchase Agreements through the expansion of the Melbourne Renewable Energy Project within a 1-5 year timeframe. Additionally, the policy also advocates for energy performance disclosure for a greater range of commercial and residential buildings within a 1-3 year timeframe. These examples demonstrate that the policy not only identifies key actions for climate change mitigation but also sets specific timeframes for their implementation, thus providing a clear roadmap for action."

The policy also mentions 'Year 1 existing budget allocation, Years 2-5 subject to annual plan and budget processes' in relation to accelerating corporate Power Purchase Agreements. However, the policy does not provide specific figures or percentages of the budget that will be allocated to these actions.

          "answer": "The document does explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. It acknowledges that climate change will affect everyone who lives, works, and plays in the city, but it also recognizes that some members of the community are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These include individuals affected by factors such as low income, age, gender, disability, and background. The document also discusses the principle of intergenerational equity, which recognizes that decisions made today will determine the future climate that children and future generations will experience. The policy also outlines a socially inclusive approach, considering factors such as income inequality, educational background, and disability when implementing the strategy. This approach aims to reduce barriers and vulnerabilities, and to deliver environmental, social, and economic benefits to the community.",

The principle of intergenerational equity recognises that decisions made today will determine the future climate that children and future generations will experience. Climate change will impact everyone who lives, works and plays in the city. However, some members of our community are more vulnerable to heatwaves, energy prices and reliability, rising food prices and the accessibility and affordability of buildings and transport infrastructure.",

          "positive": true,
          "answer": "The documents clearly outline the local government's commitment to ensuring that the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate are shared equitably. The policy emphasizes the importance of social inclusion and fairness, with a focus on vulnerable groups such as low-income individuals, the elderly, people with disabilities, and those with diverse cultural backgrounds. The policy also outlines specific considerations for different social factors, such as income inequality and educational background, in its climate change mitigation strategy. For instance, it discusses the impact of energy prices and the upfront cost of installing renewable energy or retrofitting buildings, particularly for renters and those with low income. The policy also highlights the need to develop accessible communication materials to explain programs delivered under the strategy, indicating an effort to ensure that everyone, regardless of their educational background, can understand and access climate change solutions. Therefore, the policy does explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate."
