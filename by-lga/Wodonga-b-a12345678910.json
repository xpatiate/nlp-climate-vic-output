The policy is designed to guide strategies, evaluate and assess projects and policies, and enable the Council to manage its climate change vulnerability, thereby increasing the organisation’s resilience and preparation for the future. The policy's objectives include reducing greenhouse gas emissions through appropriate mitigation strategies, applying risk management to develop adaptation strategies, conserving natural resources, and evaluating the climate change implications when making strategic and operational decisions. The policy applies to Council services and assets and is to be considered when Council and its officers make recommendations. The policy is also supported by a Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan, which outlines specific actions the council will undertake to adapt and mitigate the impacts of climate change."

The Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan (CCAAP) demonstrates the council's actions to adapt and mitigate the impacts of climate change and ways to support the community. The council has used an evidence-based approach for the development of the CCAAP by prioritizing actions based on climate risks and opportunities specific to their local region. The documents also highlight the role of local government in addressing climate change and the responsibility to incorporate climate risk mitigation and adaptation actions into all operations. The council aims to reduce the vulnerability of its assets and services, while empowering the community to be healthy, connected, and resilient."
