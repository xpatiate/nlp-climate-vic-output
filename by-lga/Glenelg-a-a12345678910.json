While the policy does address climate change and its impacts, it does not clearly establish climate action as its primary objective. The policy seems to be more focused on community development, planning, and strategic governance, with climate change being one of the many factors considered in these processes. The policy does include actions related to climate change, such as keeping the public informed about climate change impacts, incorporating climate change considerations into the Glenelg Shire planning scheme, and facilitating community-based discussions on the environmental impact of climate change. However, these actions appear to be part of a broader strategy rather than the core purpose of the policy."

The documents also mention the need for strong submissions for Natural Resource Management (NRM) funds to assist resourcing, suggesting that the implementation of these actions is contingent on the availability of resources.

The policy repeatedly mentions 'within existing budgets' as the source of funding for various climate action strategies. For instance, the policy outlines that the council will 'proactively lead the way and provide the community with mechanisms to facilitate community-based discussions on the environmental impact of climate change' and that this will be funded 'within existing budgets'. Similarly, the policy states that the council will 'ensure the impacts of climate change are incorporated into key plans and strategies' and this too will be funded 'within existing budgets'. However, the policy does not provide a clear breakdown of what these budgets are, how much is allocated specifically for climate action, or how these funds will be distributed among the various strategies. Therefore, while the policy does allocate funding for climate action, the lack of specific detail makes it difficult to assess the adequacy of this funding."

Similarly, the 'GSC, ESC, CD/CDO, RS and relevant staff' are tasked with initiating, supporting, and promoting environmental education and awareness-raising projects and events.
