Adaptation is defined as action taken to prepare for actual or expected changes in the climate, while mitigation refers to measures taken to reduce adverse effects on the environment and manage associated risks. The policy acknowledges the impacts of climate change on the community, business, industry, and the environment, and the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters. The policy also outlines the council's responsibilities, which include managing energy and water consumption efficiently, promoting the sustainability of the municipal district, and planning for climate change risks. The policy also sets long-term aims, such as supporting the community, business, and industry to respond to the impacts of a changing climate, achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for council operations by 2035, and adapting to the effects of climate change.",

          "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities in the context of 'equity and social justice'. The policy documents focus on the general impacts of climate change on the community, business, industry, and the environment. They outline the local government's plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation, including managing energy and water consumption, promoting sustainable energy options, and planning for climate change risks. However, they do not specifically address the differential impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities or discuss these impacts in terms of equity and social justice."

          "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the documents do outline the local government's plans and actions towards climate change mitigation and adaptation, they do not specifically address the distribution of benefits and opportunities in an equitable manner. The documents focus on the council's responsibilities, long-term aims, performance indicators, and example actions related to climate change. These include plans to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, support community, business, and industry in responding to climate change impacts, and promote sustainable and affordable energy options. However, these actions are not explicitly linked to equity and social justice. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that there is a discussion on how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate."
