          "answer": "The policy clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy's primary goal is to address the challenges posed by climate change and to transition to a climate-resilient city. It emphasizes the need for urgent action, as climate change impacts everyone in the community, particularly the most vulnerable. The policy outlines specific actions, such as encouraging residents and businesses to reduce their emissions and learn how to become more climate resilient. It also highlights the government's commitment to strengthening climate change and environmental policies, with ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The policy further demonstrates its commitment to climate action through its investment in assets, changes in service delivery, and collaboration with the community and partners to mitigate and adapt to climate change.",

It emphasizes the urgency of the situation, stating that climate change is affecting every country and disrupting national economies. The document also highlights the increasing pressure on life-sustaining systems such as the atmosphere, land, oceans, and biodiversity due to rising temperatures, increased flooding, rising sea levels, changing rainfall patterns, and more extreme storms. It further notes that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are at their highest levels in history, driving climate change. The document underscores the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy to tackle the climate emergency.

It emphasizes the severity of the climate crisis, stating that climate change is now affecting every country on every continent, disrupting national economies, and impacting lives. The document also highlights the increasing pressure on our atmosphere, land, oceans, and biodiversity due to human activities. It further underscores the urgency by stating that greenhouse gas emissions are at their highest levels in history and that global temperatures are likely to reach 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels in the early 2030s. The document also mentions that the City of Port Phillip declared a climate emergency in 2019, acknowledging the severe risk that climate change poses to the planet, biodiversity, and communities.

The strategy details five priority areas, including a water-sensitive city, a greener city, a city with lower greenhouse gas emissions, a city that is adapting and resilient to climate change, and a sustained reduction in waste. However, these are strategic priorities rather than a mandate for all council activities to align with climate policy. The documents also mention the council's commitment to monitoring and reporting on climate risks, encouraging community action, and implementing a Coastal Adaptation Plan.

The policy outlines several initiatives related to climate change, such as exploring partnerships to protect against flooding and sea level rise, updating the Flood Preparedness Emergency Management and Heatwave Sub-plan, and implementing the Waste Management Strategy. Each of these initiatives requires resources, both human and financial, to be effectively implemented. The policy also mentions specific monetary amounts, such as $3.629 million for waste management and $4.844 million for developing a cool spaces strategy and other climate resilience measures.

While the documents do mention initiatives to support community resilience to climate change impacts, establish partnerships for community resilience and adaptation, and support the community to lead, build, and implement action plans, they do not specifically address the equitable distribution of benefits and opportunities. The documents also mention the need to support vulnerable community members and engage residents in the transition to a climate-resilient city. However, these references do not explicitly discuss the equitable sharing of benefits and opportunities of a safe climate."
