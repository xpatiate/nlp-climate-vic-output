          "answer": "The Hume City Council Climate Action Plan 2023-2028 indeed includes specific actions for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The plan outlines a comprehensive approach to climate change, focusing on both mitigation and adaptation strategies. It includes technological solutions such as the fast adoption of electric vehicles, the investigation of renewable energy micro-generation opportunities, and the replacement of end-of-life gas appliances with electric options. The plan also emphasizes behaviour change, with a commitment to developing communications campaigns for residents to take well-informed climate action. The plan's approach to emissions reduction is informed by the emissions reduction hierarchy, which prioritizes avoiding emissions where possible, reducing emissions through efficiency and use of renewable, carbon-neutral energy, and offsetting remaining emissions that are hard to avoid. The plan also sets a carbon-neutral target by 2030 for Council operations, indicating a strong commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",

The plan outlines a multi-criteria analysis with twelve criteria used to shortlist actions with the highest priority. The three main criteria are emissions reduction impact, level of Council control or influence, and strategic alignment with Council priorities. The plan also includes specific actions, their budget, responsibility, level of priority, and timeframe for completion. For instance, the plan mentions the delivery of the Sustainability and Climate Change Community of Practice to get input from staff and build staff engagement on sustainability and climate change action. This action is within the current budget, led by the Community Health and Wellbeing department, and is of medium priority with an ongoing timeframe. This level of detail suggests that the plan has specific measurable criteria to evaluate the success of its proposed actions."
