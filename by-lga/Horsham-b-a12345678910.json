While the policy does address climate change and outlines actions related to it, it is not clear that this is the central focus. The policy's stated purpose is to guide the local government's decision-making and management practices to achieve environmentally responsible and sustainable outcomes for the municipality. It also aims to address the potential adverse impacts of climate change and promote the adoption of environmentally sustainable practices within the municipality. However, these goals are part of a broader environmental sustainability strategy, which also includes other aspects such as reducing environmental degradation, building resilience, and promoting sustainable water use. Therefore, while climate action is a significant part of the policy, it cannot be said to be the core purpose or goal based on the provided documents."

The Victorian Climate Change Green Paper, released in 2009, is the government's response to climate change, aiming to stimulate discussion about policy responses. The proposed policy response focuses on three key areas: complementing the national Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, positioning Victoria to take advantage of opportunities created by the transition to a carbon-constrained economy, and adapting to the impacts of climate change that can no longer be avoided. The Environment Sustainability Strategy 2010 also outlines objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, develop procurement policies favoring environmentally friendly products, and plan responses to extreme events. The documents also highlight the potential adverse impacts of climate change, such as increased cost of living, health costs, and insurance costs, and the need to protect natural assets from these impacts.",
