The policy, titled 'Climate Response Plan 2021 - 2031', is explicitly designed to address the challenges of climate change and to guide the local government's response. The policy outlines a series of actions aimed at minimizing climate impacts, building a resilient community, and protecting ecosystems. These actions are intended to be ambitious, inclusive, fair, relevant, actionable, and evidence-based. The policy also includes measures for tracking progress and evaluating the effectiveness of the actions, with a focus on reducing emissions and climate risk. The policy also emphasizes the importance of community involvement and equitable solutions. Therefore, it is clear that the core purpose of the policy is climate action.",

The documents do mention that the council will review key policies to ensure climate change impacts are considered during decision making and that future council reports will be assessed against the Climate Response Plan. However, this does not necessarily mean that all council activities must be aligned with the climate policy.

The plan outlines various actions related to climate change, such as engaging with public sector service providers, developing financial impact analysis studies, identifying infrastructure requiring long-term adaptation measures, and undertaking feasibility studies of future-proofing the stormwater system. Each of these actions implies a financial commitment. More specifically, the document provides an approximate value of existing resources as $4.0m and an approximate total of $32.5m for the period 2021-31. This allocation of funds demonstrates a clear commitment to mobilising institutional resources for climate action. However, the document does not provide a detailed breakdown of how these funds will be distributed among the various actions, which could be a point of concern for ensuring the effective and efficient use of resources."

It acknowledges that climate change, particularly the increased frequency of heatwaves and storms, may exacerbate existing health sensitivities, accommodation stress, and isolation among vulnerable members of the community, including older people and people living with a disability. The document outlines specific actions to support these vulnerable populations, such as upfront planning for emergency events, identifying areas where urban heat islands intersect with vulnerable populations, and prioritizing investment in urban cooling measures. These actions demonstrate a clear recognition of the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable communities and a commitment to addressing these impacts in a fair and equitable manner.",

          "answer": "The document does explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate. The policy outlines a commitment to fairness, seeking solutions that equitably address the risks of climate change and share the costs and benefits of action across the community. This commitment is reflected in the policy's actions, which include measures to protect community health and resilience, particularly for vulnerable members of the community such as older people and people living with a disability. The policy also includes measures to increase the resilience of infrastructure, which will benefit all members of the community. Furthermore, the policy's commitment to inclusivity, involving community, business, and other stakeholders in finding solutions, suggests a commitment to ensuring that all members of the community have a say in how the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate are shared."
