The policy outlines the local government's commitment to integrating climate change considerations across its operations and actively advocating for climate change mitigation and adaptation within the community. The policy sets out specific goals, such as achieving carbon neutrality by 2025, and outlines a range of strategic tasks and actions to achieve these goals. These include implementing the Regional Climate Adaptation Plan, developing and implementing a Climate Change Action Plan, and managing and minimising the impacts of extreme weather events. The policy also commits to monitoring and reporting on its progress in achieving these goals. Therefore, it is evident that climate action is not just a peripheral concern, but a central objective of the policy.",

The documents outline key actions to achieve this goal, including reducing methane pollution from landfills, installing renewable energy capacity, optimizing and gradually electrifying the vehicle fleet, and implementing substantial energy efficiency measures. The documents also emphasize the importance of adaptation measures, particularly for the most vulnerable people and places, and the role of community-based and regional climate change response projects.

For instance, the Council aims to achieve 100% renewable electricity supply by 2022 and zero-net emissions buildings by 2025. The documents also mention annual reporting on the progress of the action plan, indicating a continuous monitoring and evaluation process."

The plan outlines various actions and assigns responsibility to specific departments or roles within the local government. For instance, the 'Healthy Environments' department is tasked with implementing further actions related to climate adaptation, utilising natural environment expertise during significant procurements, and developing a climate change informed response to street tree replacement and urban forestry. The 'Organisational Development' department is tasked with providing professional development training to planning staff about climate change ready developments. The 'Finance' department is tasked with ensuring that climate change adaptation is fully considered in the Council’s risk register and in project and contract management. The 'Governance and Customer Service' department is tasked with developing a checklist for considering climate change during the internal development of major project proposals.
