The policy aims to help the Council and stakeholders understand the impacts of climate change in the region, identify the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and reduced water availability, clarify the Council's role and scope for taking action on these issues, and identify measures the Council can adopt to address risks and act on opportunities. The policy focuses on the impact of climate change and reduced water availability across four main themes: the regional economy, utilities infrastructure, community infrastructure, and the Council's capacity to meet the needs of its community as the climate and water availability changes. The policy also outlines specific actions for the Council to take in response to climate change, such as advocating for ongoing research and development to assist the agricultural industry adapt to the changing climate.",

The documents detail the actions to be taken, who within the council is responsible for implementing them, and the timeframe for implementation. For example, the 'Review and update the Road Asset Management plan' action is assigned to the Infrastructure Services department and is expected to be completed within 3 years.

The documents also mention other policies and plans, such as the Municipal Fire Prevention Plan and the Municipal Public Health Plan, which are yet to consider and identify appropriate responses to climate change.

The policy outlines a number of actions that involve the use of staff resources. For instance, it mentions that council staff are to review and analyze current asset management plans under a range of climate change and water availability scenarios. This includes areas such as stormwater drainage capacity maintenance, road construction and design, and building maintenance, upgrade, and design. The policy also emphasizes the importance of community engagement, which would require the allocation of staff resources for effective communication and education on the council's adaptation and sustainability projects. Furthermore, the policy mentions the need to liaise with major businesses, service providers, and neighboring municipalities to develop packages offering employment opportunities with the council for couples and families.
