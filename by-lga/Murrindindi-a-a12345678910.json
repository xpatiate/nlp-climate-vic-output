The policy is designed to address climate change through four central goals: Governance Foundations, Climate Mitigation, Climate Adaptation, and Community Mobilisation. The policy aims to develop internal knowledge and systems to consider climate change in decision-making across the organisation. It also seeks to address the crisis at its root by achieving net zero by 2035 and meeting interim targets. The policy also aims to minimise the impacts of climate change on Council’s infrastructure and services. Furthermore, the policy is set to be regularly reviewed to reflect changed conditions and community priorities. The policy also outlines specific actions, such as educating staff and councillors on managing climate risks and communicating climate risks to the public.",

          "answer": "The provided documents do not refer to any specific regional associations, alliances, or other partnerships related to climate action. While the documents do discuss the local government's plans and strategies for addressing climate change, including community engagement, education, and the promotion of low-emission technologies, they do not mention any specific partnerships or collaborations with external organizations or entities. The documents focus primarily on the local government's internal actions and responsibilities, such as establishing financial management systems that support climate action, educating staff and councillors on managing climate risks, and publishing a comprehensive community emissions profile. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be affirmed that the local government is involved in any specific regional associations, alliances, or other partnerships related to climate action."

          "answer": "The provided documents do not explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities in terms of equity and social justice. While the documents do mention community concerns about climate change, the focus is primarily on general community perspectives, emergency management, agricultural emissions, and transport emissions. The documents also discuss the council's role in supporting the transition to a net zero region and the community's efforts to increase renewable energy. However, there is no specific mention or discussion about the differential impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities or any measures to address equity and social justice in the context of climate change."

          "positive": false,
          "answer": "The documents provided do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of equity and social justice. While the policy does mention various actions related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, such as running community development programs, providing direct resourcing and support to households, community groups, businesses, farms, and service providers, and supporting youth-led climate and sustainability action, it does not specifically address the equitable distribution of these benefits and opportunities. The policy also mentions the development of libraries and customer service centres as climate resilience hubs, but again, there is no explicit mention of how these benefits will be shared equitably. Therefore, based on the provided documents, the question cannot be answered in the affirmative."
