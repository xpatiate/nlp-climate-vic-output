          "answer": "The policy under review, the Climate Emergency Strategic Action Plan, clearly identifies climate action as its core purpose. The policy is designed to respond to the climate emergency by integrating strong mitigation, adaptation, and advocacy measures across all Indigo Shire Council (ISC) services. The policy sets six strategic priorities to focus the climate emergency response, with more detailed actions to be developed and costed under each strategic priority. The policy also emphasizes the importance of embedding the climate change lens into all operational and strategic policy and decision making, and increasing the resilience of Council’s infrastructure and service delivery by building internal capacity to absorb, adapt, and adjust to the expected shocks of climate change. The policy also aims to cultivate a climate change culture within the council, valuing, prioritizing, and championing the application of a climate change lens to all council decisions, operations, and functions."

The plan sets strategic priorities to focus the climate emergency response, with detailed actions to be developed under each strategic priority. The Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan also emphasizes the need for adaptation to climate change, stating that despite efforts to mitigate climate change, some form of adaptation is inevitable. The plan aims to increase the resilience of Council’s infrastructure and service delivery by building internal capacity to absorb, adapt, and adjust to the expected shocks of climate change. These documents demonstrate a clear understanding of the need for action on climate change and a commitment to implementing strategies to address this issue."

For instance, it mentions actions that are considered 'quick wins', which are immediate actions, actions to be completed within 1 year (S), within 2-3 years (M), and those that will take 3+ years (L). The document also mentions that the new Council has 12 months to deliver the Council Plan and that the review of plans and policies could start before this. Furthermore, the document mentions that culture change is a long-term undertaking, indicating a timeframe that extends beyond the immediate future. Therefore, the document does provide specific timeframes for its intended actions on climate, ranging from immediate actions to those planned for the longer term."

The documents also mention the need to review all policies, plans, and procedures through the climate emergency lens and make any changes required to align with the Climate Change Policy and this Action Plan.

The plan also mentions that the implementation of the Adaptation Plan will be assisted by the introduction of the Council’s Climate Change Policy, which will inform future budgetary decisions. However, the documents do not provide specific budget allocations or detailed financial plans for the proposed actions.
