The policy, titled 'Environmental Sustainability Strategy Action Plan 2013-2018', appears to be a broad strategy encompassing various aspects of environmental sustainability, including energy management, water management, biodiversity, land management and planning, sustainable transport, waste, and business and industry development. While climate action could be inferred as a component of these areas, it is not explicitly stated as the core purpose or goal. The policy also aligns with the strategic platforms and core business elements of the Loddon Shire Council, which include a range of areas beyond environmental sustainability. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be definitively stated that climate action is the core purpose or goal of the policy."

For instance, the document mentions advocating for business opportunities for large-scale renewable energy projects within the municipality from 2013 to 2018. It also mentions implementing a program for the upgrade and improvement of automated watering systems for municipal public places from 2014 to 2018. Furthermore, the document suggests conducting an audit of all Council buildings to identify required improvement works and associated opportunities to improve utilization through multiuse arrangements from 2015 to 2016. These specific timeframes indicate a clear plan of action and a commitment to addressing environmental sustainability within a defined period."

For instance, the policy includes a plan to maintain a car pool policy with a budget of $5,000 (T2). Additionally, the policy outlines a plan to upgrade street lighting to high-efficiency technology with a budget of $80,000 (E7). However, many of the actions listed in the policy do not have a specified budget, instead listing 'NIL' under the budget column. This could indicate that these actions will be funded through other means, or that the budget for these actions has not yet been determined. It is also worth noting that the policy includes a plan to seek external funding for a part-time resource dedicated to environmental management (B6)."

The policy outlines several actions related to climate change and sustainability, and assigns responsibility for these actions to various roles within the institution. For instance, the Plant Replacement committee is tasked with incorporating energy efficiency assessments into their procurement recommendations (T1). The CEO is responsible for maintaining a carpool policy (T2). The Director Operations (DOP) is tasked with advocating for improvements in water security and quality (WR1). The Manager Infrastructure Program Development (MINFPD) is involved in implementing a program for the upgrade and improvement of automated watering systems (WR2).

The policy outlines several actions that aim to engage the community in environmental sustainability. For instance, it recommends the incorporation of educational or informative material on the Council's new website, including links to external agency websites, relating to opportunities for the improvement or enhancement of environmental sustainability within local households and businesses. This action suggests an effort to educate the community about environmental sustainability and provide them with resources to take action. Additionally, the policy advocates for business opportunities for large-scale renewable energy projects within the municipality and encourages collaboration with neighbouring municipalities to capitalise on regional opportunities. This action could potentially mobilise businesses and other stakeholders in the community to work together on renewable energy projects."

The plan outlines several actions related to energy management and sustainable transport, which are directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, the plan recommends an energy efficiency audit of all Shire buildings to identify potential opportunities for cost-effective improvements such as draught proofing, double glazing, use of LED lighting, and better roof insulation. This is a clear example of a technological solution aimed at reducing energy consumption and thus greenhouse gas emissions. The plan also suggests reviewing the vehicle policy to encourage the choice of energy-efficient vehicles in employment packages to staff, which is an example of promoting behaviour change to reduce emissions. Furthermore, the plan advocates for business opportunities for large-scale renewable energy projects within the municipality, which is another technological solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",
