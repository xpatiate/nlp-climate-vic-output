The policy outlines the local government's planned actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change up to 2032. It presents an analysis of trends impacting the climate and environment and is informed by feedback from institutional stakeholders and the wider community. The policy is committed to delivering actions across six themes, one of which is climate change. The policy also outlines a review process in 2027 and 2032, in line with the latest climate science, emissions profile, and inventory updates, as well as new mitigation and adaptation technologies that become available. This indicates a long-term commitment to climate action. The policy also includes a focus on community engagement and consultation, indicating an inclusive approach to climate action.",
