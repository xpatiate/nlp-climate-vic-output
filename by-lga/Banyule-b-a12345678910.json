The policy outlines a comprehensive plan to address climate change, with a focus on reducing emissions and adapting to a changing climate. The policy acknowledges the urgency of climate action, citing the United Nations warning that we have until 2030 to keep global temperature rise to a maximum of 1.5 degrees. The policy also outlines specific actions to be taken, such as embedding a culture of climate action within the Council, implementing a cultural change program, and establishing a Climate Action Steering Committee. These actions demonstrate a commitment to climate action at all levels of the Council. Furthermore, the policy includes a Monitoring, Evaluation, Reporting and Improvement (MERI) framework, which will allow for the effectiveness of the climate action measures to be assessed and improved upon. This further underscores the centrality of climate action to the policy.",

The plan outlines a number of actions that involve the mobilisation of staff and institutional resources. For instance, the plan includes the establishment of a Climate Action Steering Committee to guide the implementation of new climate action projects and increase collaboration between departments. This suggests that staff time and expertise will be allocated to this committee. Additionally, the plan outlines a cultural change program across the Council, embedding climate action as a responsibility of all staff. This implies that staff will be expected to incorporate climate action into their roles, which is a significant allocation of human resources.

This indicates a clear technological strategy for reducing emissions. The plan also includes a cultural change program across the Council, embedding climate action as an all-staff responsibility, which signifies a behavioural change approach.

          "answer": "The documents provided do not explicitly discuss how to equitably share the benefits and opportunities of a safe climate in terms of 'equity and social justice'. While the policy outlines various actions and strategies to combat climate change and reduce emissions, it does not delve into the distribution of benefits and opportunities that may arise from these actions. The policy emphasizes collaboration, continuous improvement, and innovation across the organization, and it also mentions the need for a culture of climate action within the Council. However, these points do not directly address the question of equity and social justice in the context of climate change benefits and opportunities. Therefore, based on the provided documents, the question cannot be answered positively."
