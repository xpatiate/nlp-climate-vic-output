The policy is titled 'Climate Change and Environment Strategy' and it outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change and environmental sustainability. The policy is guided by the One Planet Living principles, which include 'Health and happiness', 'Equity and local economy', and 'Culture and community'. These principles are incorporated into the policy's goals and targets, which are designed to promote environmental sustainability, including climate change risk. The policy also outlines a governance process for monitoring, evaluating, and reporting on progress towards these goals. Furthermore, the policy includes specific action areas, such as 'Biodiversity and regeneration', 'Zero carbon', and 'Circular economy', which directly address climate change and environmental sustainability. Therefore, it is clear that climate action is the core purpose or goal of the policy."

Technological solutions include the progressive replacement of the Council's lightweight vehicle fleet with electric vehicles, the installation of electric vehicle charging stations powered by renewable energy at selected Council sites, and the development of a policy mandating no new gas connections in Council owned and operated buildings. The plan also includes actions aimed at behaviour change, such as supporting 1,000 local households and 100 businesses, schools, and organisations in creating climate action plans to achieve a 2030 target.
